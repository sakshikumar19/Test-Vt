QUESTION: How can I monitor or get metrics from Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Monitoring Vitess

To monitor or get metrics from Vitess, you can use the following methods:

1. **Vitess Status Pages**: Access the status HTML pages of various Vitess components by pointing your browser to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/status`. This will display basic information for monitoring, such as QPS graphs.
2. **Pull-based Metrics System**: Vitess exposes metrics using Go's `expvar` package. You can configure a pull-based metrics system to ingest these metrics, which are published to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/vars` as JSON key-value pairs.
3. **VTGate Web UI**: The VTGate web UI provides several pages for monitoring, including:
	* `/debug/status`: Displays the status of the VTGate server and connected tablets.
	* `/debug/vars`: Contains metrics such as `VTGateApi` and `HealthcheckConnections`.
	* `/debug/query_plans`: Provides query plans for monitoring.

These methods allow you to monitor the state of your Vitess cluster and gather metrics for performance optimization and troubleshooting.

background processing jobs, such as taking backups, dumping data to other systems, heavy analytical queries, and resharding. There are some other tablet types like `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`. For information on how to use tablets please review this [user guide](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/vttablet-mysql/). ## What is a shard? A shard is a physical division within a keyspace; i.e. how data is split across multiple MySQL instances. A shard typically consists of one MySQL primary and one or more MySQL replicas. Each MySQL instance within a shard has the same data, if the effect of MySQL replication lag is ignored. The replicas can serve read-only traffic, execute long-running queries from data analysis tools, or perform administrative tasks. An unsharded keyspace always has only a single shard. --- title: Metrics weight: 7 --- ## How can I monitor or get metrics from Vitess? All Vitess components have a web UI that you can access to see the state of each component. The first place to look is the `/debug/status` page. * This is the main landing page for a VTGate, which displays the status of a particular server. A list of tablets this VTGate process is connected to is also displayed, as this is the list of tablets that can potentially serve queries. A second place to look is the `/debug/vars` page. For example, for VTGate, this page contains the following items: * VTGateApi - This is the main histogram variable to track for VTGates. It gives you a breakdown of all queries by command, keyspace, and type. * HealthcheckConnections - It shows the number of tablet connections for query/healthcheck per keyspace, shard, and tablet type. There are two other pages you can use to get monitoring information from Vitess in the VTGate web UI: * `/debug/query_plans` - This URL gives you all the query plans

purging. --- title: Monitoring weight: 8 --- # Current state of monitoring There are currently three main ways that a Vitess cluster can be monitored. Depending on your needs, you can use any of the following methods: ## 1. Vitess status pages The status HTML pages of various Vitess components can be accessed by pointing your browser to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/status`. The status pages will often display some basic, but useful, information for monitoring. For example, the status page of a vttablet will show the QPS graph for the past few minutes. Viewing a status page can be useful since it works out of the box, but it only provides very basic monitoring capabilities. ## 2. Pull-based metrics system Vitess uses Goâ€™s [expvar package](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/) to expose various metrics, with the expectation that a user can configure a pull-based metrics system to ingest those metrics. Metrics are published to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/vars` as JSON key-value pairs, which should be easy for any metrics system to parse. Scraping Vitess variables is a good way to integrate Vitess into an existing monitoring system, and is useful for building up detailed monitoring dashboards. It is also the officially supported way for monitoring Vitess. ## 3. Push-based metrics system Vitess also includes support for push-based metrics systems via plug-ins. Each Vitess component would need to be run with the `--emit_stats` flag. By default, the stats_emit_period is 60s, so each component will push stats to the selected backend every minute. This is configurable via the `--stats_emit_period` flag. Vitess has preliminary plug-ins to support OpenTSDB as a push-based metrics backend. It should be fairly straightforward to write your own plug-in, if you want to support a different backend. The plug-in package simply needs to implement the `PushBackend` interface of the `stats` package. For an example, you can see the [OpenTSDB plugin](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/stats/opentsdb/opentsdb.go).

and type. * HealthcheckConnections - It shows the number of tablet connections for query/healthcheck per keyspace, shard, and tablet type. There are two other pages you can use to get monitoring information from Vitess in the VTGate web UI: * `/debug/query_plans` - This URL gives you all the query plans for queries going through VTGate. * `/debug/vschema` - This URL shows the VSchema as loaded by VTGate. VTTablet has a similar web UI. Vitess component metrics can also be scraped via /metrics. This will provide a Prometheus-format metric dump that is updated continuously. This is the recommended way to collect metrics from Vitess. ## How do you integrate Prometheus and Vitess? There is an Prometheus exporter that is on by default that enables you to configure a Prometheus compatible scraper to grab data from the various Vitess components. All Vitess components export their metrics on their http port at `/metrics`. If your Vitess configuration includes running the Vitess Operator on Kubernetes, then you can have Prometheus or a Prometheus compatible agent running in your Kubernetes cluster. This would then scrape the metrics from Vitess automatically, as it would be run on the ports advertised and on our standard `/metrics` page. You can read more about getting the metrics into Prometheus [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config). --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## What is Vitess? **Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of database instances.** It is architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many SQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database. Vitess can help you with the following problems: * Scaling a SQL database by allowing you to shard it, while keeping your application changes to a minimum. * Migrating from
