QUESTION: How do I migrate out of Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Migrating Out of Vitess
The provided context does not discuss migrating out of Vitess. It focuses on migrating data into Vitess, the methods for doing so, and other Vitess-related topics such as VStream, replication, and the topology service.

To accurately answer your question, I would need more information on the specific requirements and constraints of your migration, such as the target database system, the size of the database, and any downtime tolerance.

If you're looking to migrate out of Vitess, you might consider the following steps, but please note that these are general suggestions and may not apply directly to your situation:

1. **Assess the Current State**: Evaluate your current Vitess setup, including the database size, structure, and any custom configurations.
2. **Choose a Target System**: Decide on the database system you want to migrate to, considering factors like compatibility, scalability, and performance requirements.
3. **Export Data**: Use Vitess tools or MySQL-compatible export methods to extract your data. This might involve using `mysqldump` or other data export utilities.
4. **Transform Data (if necessary)**: Depending on the differences between Vitess and your target system, you might need to transform your data to ensure compatibility.
5. **Import Data**: Use the import tools provided by your target database system to load the exported data.

For detailed guidance on migrating out of Vitess, I recommend consulting the official Vitess documentation or seeking advice from a database migration expert familiar with both Vitess and your target database system.

hosted MySQL like RDS on AWS, CloudSQL on GCP, or Azure managed MySQL, because you are not coming from MySQL you have to use either the ‘Stop-the-world’ method or the method using VReplication setup in front of the existing external database. You can read more about those two methods [here](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/migration/migrate-data/). There is no option to do an application level migration. The biggest challenge with this sort of migration is you must be able to access the source database from the location where you want to put the target database. You will need to ensure this configuration constraint is resolved and set up prior to any sort of migration. ## What is Vstream and how does it work? VStream is a change notification service accessible via VTGate. The purpose of VStream is to provide equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards. gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, can subscribe to a VStream to receive change events from other shards. The VStream pulls events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This allows for efficient execution of functions such as VReplication where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards, and then apply it to a target instance. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## How do I migrate my data to Vitess? There are two main parts to migrating your data to Vitess: migrating the actual data and repointing the application. The answer here will focus primarily on the methods that can be used to migrate your data into Vitess. There are three different methods to migrate your data into Vitess. Choosing the appropriate option depends on several factors like:

source and target tables are left unchanged and in the same state they were at the moment the VReplication stream was deleted. {{</ info >}} --- title: Migrating Data Into Vitess weight: 1 aliases: ['/docs/user-guides/migrate-data/'] --- # Introduction There are two main parts to migrating your data to Vitess: migrating the actual data and repointing the application. This page will focus primarily on the methods that can be used to migrate *your data* into Vitess. ## Overview There are different methods to migrate your data into Vitess. Choosing the appropriate option depends on several factors: 1. The nature of the application accessing the MySQL database 1. The size of the MySQL database to be migrated 1. The load, especially the write load, on the MySQL database 1. Your tolerance for downtime during the migration of data 1. Whether you require the ability to reverse the migration if needed 1. The network level configuration of your components The two primary methods are: * Dump and Restore * VReplication (**Recommended**) ## Dump and Restore {{< warning >}} This method likely isn’t viable for most production applications as it will incur significant application downtime. {{</ warning >}} The simplest method to migrate data is to do a data dump and restore (AKA "stop-the-world"). For this we recommend using [`mysqldump`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/mysqldump.html) or [`go-mydumper`](https://github.com/aquarapid/go-mydumper). To execute this method you would follow these steps: 1. Stop writing to the source MySQL database 1. Take a logical dump of the database 1. Apply any simple transformations on the output if needed 1. Import the data into Vitess via the frontend [Vitess Gateway](../../../concepts/vtgate/) (`vtgate`) 1. Repoint your application to the new database via a [Vitess Gateway](../../../concepts/vtgate/) and resume writing This method is only suitable for migrating small or non-critical databases that can tolerate downtime. The database will be unavailable

Workflow Lifecycle {{< info >}} NOTE: there is no reverse vreplication flow with [`Migrate`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_migrate/). After the [`Migrate complete`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_migrate/vtctldclient_migrate_complete/) command is given; no writes will be replicated between the Source and Target Vitess clusters. They are essentially two identical Vitess clusters running in two different environments. Once writing resumes on one of the clusters they will begin to drift apart. {{< /info >}} 1. Mount the source Vitess cluster using [Mount](../mount).<br/> `Mount register --name ext1 --topo-type etcd2 --topo-server localhost:12379 --topo-root /vitess/global` 1. Apply source vSchema to the Target's Keyspace.<br/> `ApplyVSchema --vschema-file commerceVschema.json commerce` 1. Initiate the migration using `create`.<br/> `Migrate --workflow import --target-keyspace customer create --source-keyspace commerce --mount-name ext1 --tablet-types replica` 1. Monitor the workflow using `show` and `status`.<br/> `Migrate --workflow import --target-keyspace customer show` `Migrate --workflow import --target-keyspace customer status` 1. Confirm that data has been copied over correctly using [VDiff](../vdiff).<br/> 1. Stop the application from writing to the source Vitess cluster.<br/> 1. Confirm again the data has been copied over correctly using [VDiff](../vdiff).<br/> 1. Cleanup vreplication artifacts and source tables with `complete`.<br /> `Migrate --workflow import --target-keyspace customer complete` 1. Start the application pointed to the target Vitess Cluster. 1. Unmount the source cluster.<br/> `Mount unregister --name ext1` ### Parameters ### Action [`Migrate`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_migrate/) is an "umbrella" command. The [`action` or sub-command](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_migrate/#see-also) defines the operation on the workflow. ### Options Each [`action` or sub-command](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_migrate/#see-also) has additional options/parameters that can be used to modify its behavior. Please see the [command's reference docs](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_migrate/) for the full list of command options or flags. The options for the supported commands are the same as [MoveTables](../movetables), with the exception of `--enable-reverse-replication` as setting up the reverse vreplication streams requires modifying the source cluster's `_vt` sidecar database which we cannot do as that database is specific to a single Vitess cluster and these streams belong to
