QUESTION: Describe the process of setting up gRPC TLS encryption between vtgate and vttablet instances?

ANSWER: ### Setting up gRPC TLS Encryption between vtgate and vttablet Instances
To set up gRPC TLS encryption between vtgate and vttablet instances, follow these steps:

1. **Generate a certificate for vttablet**: Use Easy-RSA to generate a certificate for vttablet.
   ```bash
$ cd ~/CA/
$ ./easyrsa gen-req vttablet1 nopass
```
2. **Configure vttablet gRPC for TLS**: Configure vttablet to use the generated certificate for gRPC TLS encryption.
3. **Configure vtgate to connect to vttablet using TLS**: Update vtgate configuration to connect to vttablet using TLS over gRPC.
4. **Configure other components to connect to vttablet using TLS**: Update configurations for other components (e.g., other vttablets, vtctld) to connect to vttablet using TLS over gRPC.

Note: If you don't configure all components to connect using TLS, you may end up with a partially or wholly non-functional system. 

For more detailed information on generating certificates and configuring TLS encryption, refer to the provided context or additional Vitess documentation.

to require all TCP/IP clients to use TLS, you can use the MySQL server option `require_secure_transport`, or you can enforce it on a per MySQL user basis by using the `REQUIRE SSL` option when creating or altering a MySQL-level user. See the MySQL documentation for details. Restart your MySQL server to make these MySQL server option configuration changes active. Now, configure vttablet to connect to MySQL using the necessary parameters, verifying the CA certificate: ```bash $ cp /home/user/CA/pki/ca.crt ~/config/ ``` Add the vttablet parameters: ``` --db_ssl_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt --db_flags 1073743872 --db_server_name mysql1 ``` Restart the vttablet. Note that the `db_server_name` parameter value will differ depending on your issued certificate common name; and is unnecessary if the certificate common name matches the DNS name vttablet is using to connect to the MySQL server. The `1073743872` is a combination of the MySQL `CLIENT_SSL` (2048) and `CLIENT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` flags (1073741824); which means "encrypt the connection to MySQL *and* verify the SSL cert presented by the server". If you just wish to encrypt the vttablet -> MySQL server communication and you do not care about server certificate validation, you can just use this vttablet flag instead: ``` --db_flags 2048 ``` Note that using the above `db_flags` will also result in the MySQL to MySQL communication for replication between the replica/rdonly instances of a Vitess shard and its primary to be encrypted, as long as the upstream MySQL instance the replica is connecting to has been configured correctly to support TLS MySQL protocol connections (see above). ## vttablet data and control paths In Vitess, communication between vtgate and vttablet instances are via gRPC. gRPC uses HTTP/2 as a transport protocol, but by default this is not encrypted in Vitess. To secure this data path you need to, at a minimum, configure TLS for gRPC on the server (vttablet) side. Other components, as detailed above, also connect to vttablet via gRPC. After configuring vttablet gRPC for TLS, you will need to configure all these components (vtgate, other vttablets, vtctld) explicitly to connect using TLS to vttablet via gRPC, or you will have a partially or wholly non-functional system. #### vtgate to vttablet First, generate a certificate for use by vttablet: ```bash $ cd ~/CA/ $ ./easyrsa gen-req vttablet1 nopass Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: /home/user/CA/vars Using SSL: openssl OpenSSL 1.1.1g FIPS 21 Apr 2020 Generating a RSA private key ..................................+++++ .....+++++ writing new private key to '/home/user/CA/pki/easy-rsa-209692.tdDNNt/tmp.hwhw8x' ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.

have configured TLS on the vttablet side, you may see errors like this in the vttablet logs: ``` W1004 13:34:16.352458 212354 server.go:650] grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "[::1]:51492": tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake ``` Conversely, if you have configured the TLS parameters on the vtgate side and the vtgate instance is still trying to connect to vttablet instances that are not configured with the correct TLS options, you might see errors like this in the vtgate logs: ``` W1004 14:38:29.383672 214179 tablet_health_check.go:323] tablet cell:"zone1" uid:101 healthcheck stream error: Code: UNAVAILABLE vttablet: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake" ``` In case of VTOrc, you will need to add following to VTOrc instance to successfully connect to this vttablet instance ``` --tablet_manager_grpc_server_name vttablet1 --tablet_manager_grpc_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt ``` #### vttablet to vtablet: vreplication within or across shards For vreplication to work between vttablet instances once the gRPC server TLS options above are activated, you will need to add the following additional vttablet options: ``` --tablet_grpc_server_name vttablet1 --tablet_grpc_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt ``` Since each vttablet instance may need to talk to more than one other vttablet instances for vreplication streams, the implication is that each vttablet instances needs to either: * Use the same vttablet server key material and server certificate common name for each vttablet instance. This is obviously the easiest option, but might not conform to your compliance requirements. * or, ensure each vttablet server certificate common name or IP SAN matches the DNS name or IP it it accessed via. In this case, you can omit the use of the `--tablet_grpc_server_name` above for vttablet, and also for vtgate. #### vtctld to vttablet Once your vttablet(s) are configured with gRPC server TLS options as above, you will need to also add TLS client options to vtctld, or vtctld will be unable to connect to your vttablet(s). * To achieve this, add the following options to the vtctld commandline: ``` --tablet_grpc_server_name vttablet1 --tablet_grpc_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt --tablet_manager_grpc_server_name vttablet1 --tablet_manager_grpc_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt ``` ### vtctldclient to vtctld The communication from vtctldclient to vtctld is also via gRPC, so the method for securing it is similar to vtctld to vttablet above. Generate a server certificate for vtctld: ```bash $ cd ~/CA/ $ ./easyrsa gen-req vtctld1 nopass Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: /home/user/CA/vars Using SSL: openssl OpenSSL 1.1.1g FIPS 21 Apr 2020 Generating a RSA private key ..................................................+++++ ....................................................+++++ writing new private key to '/home/user/CA/pki/easy-rsa-234817.QW1l8f/tmp.REK9r3' ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.

enable TLS: - `--[vtgate|tablet]_grpc_ca`: list of server cert signers to trust. I.E. the client will only connect to servers presenting a cert signed by one of the CAs in this file. - `--[vtgate|tablet]_grpc_server_name`: common name of the server cert to trust. Instead of the hostname used to connect or IP SAN if using an IP to connect. - `--[vtgate|tablet]_grpc_cert`, `--[vtgate|tablet]_grpc_key`: client side cert and key to use in cases when the server requires client authentication. * Other clients can take similar parameters, in various ways. Please view each client's parameters for more information. With these options, it is possible to use TLS-secured connections for all parts of the gRPC system. This enables the server side to authenticate the client, and/or the client to authenticate the server. This is not enabled by default, as usually the different Vitess servers will run on a private network. It is also important to note, that in a Cloud environment, for example, usually all local traffic is already secured between VMs. ### Options for vtctld | Name | Type | Definition | | :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | | --tablet_grpc_ca | string | the server ca to use to validate servers when connecting | | --tablet_grpc_cert | string | the cert to use to connect | | --tablet_grpc_key | string | the key to use to connect | | --tablet_grpc_server_name | string | the server name to use to validate server certificate | | --tablet_manager_grpc_ca | string | the server ca to use to validate servers when connecting | | --tablet_manager_grpc_cert | string | the cert to use to connect | | --tablet_manager_grpc_key | string | the key to use to connect | | --tablet_manager_grpc_server_name | string | the server name to use to validate server certificate | | --throttler_client_grpc_ca | string | the server ca to use to validate servers when connecting | | --throttler_client_grpc_cert | string | the cert to use to connect | | --throttler_client_grpc_key | string | the key to use to connect | | --throttler_client_grpc_server_name | string | the server name to use to validate server certificate | | --vtgate_grpc_ca | string | the server ca to use to validate servers when connecting | | --vtgate_grpc_cert | string | the cert to use to connect | | --vtgate_grpc_key | string | the key to use to connect | | --vtgate_grpc_server_name | string | the server name to use to validate server certificate | ### Options for vtgate | Name | Type | Definition | | :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | | --tablet_grpc_ca | string | the server ca to use to validate servers when connecting | | --tablet_grpc_cert | string | the cert to use to connect | | --tablet_grpc_key | string | the key to use to connect | | --tablet_grpc_server_name | string | the server name to use to validate server certificate | ### Options for vttablet | Name | Type | Definition | | :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | | --binlog_player_grpc_ca | string |

the data, meta-data and control paths enumerated above, they use one of three protocols: * MySQL binary protocol * gRPC (using HTTP/2 as transport) * HTTP ## Encryption All three the protocol types above use TLS in one form or another to encrypt communications. Therefore the basics around encrypting a specific client to server communication is straightforward: * Server-side: * Generate a CA private key and cert as the root for your certificate hierarchy. * (optionally) Generate intermediate keys to serve as signing keys for your server certificates. We will not cover this case in this document. * Generate a private key for the server component involved. * Generate a CSR using the private key. * Use the CA key material and the CSR to generate/sign the server certificate. * Install the server cert and private key using the appropriate Vitess options for the component in question. * If required, adjust other Vitess component options to enforce/require TLS-only communications. ## Server authentication In addition to encrypting the connection, you may want or need to configure client-side server authentication. This is the process by which the client verifies that the server it is trying to establish a TLS connection to is who they claim to be, and not an imposter or man-in-the-middle. We achieve this by: * Client-side: * Install the CA cert used by your certificate issuing process to sign the server component certificates. * Adjust the Vitess client component options to verify the server certificate using the installed CA cert. This would typically involve specifying the CA cert, as well as the server or common name to expect from the server component, if it isn't the same as the DNS name (or has an IP SAN configured). ## Client authentication Client authentication in Vitess can take two forms, depending on the protocol in question: * TLS client certificate authentication (also known as mTLS) * Username/password authentication; this is only an option for the connections involving the MySQL protocol. ## Walkthroughs We will now cover how to setup the various TLS component combinations. We will start with the data path, then move on to the control paths. We will handle [encryption](#encryption) and [server authentication](#server-authentication) together, and then handle [client authentication](#client-authentication) separately. ### Certificate generation As discussed above, large organizations will often have established tools to secure a TLS certificate hierarchy and issue certificates. For the purpose of these walkthroughs, we could use bare `openssl` commands to step through every detail. However, since we consider this an implementation detail that is likely to vary from user to user, we will leverage a shell-script-based tool called [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) that uses `openssl` under the covers, and hides much of the complexity. This tool has been around for many years as part of the OpenVPN project, and can perform all the steps to setup a CA, generate server certificates and also client certificates if desired. Since `easy-rsa` is just a set of shell scripts, if you require a closer understanding of how every step works,
