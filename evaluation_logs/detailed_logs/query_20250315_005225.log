QUESTION: What is the significance of the '-' prefix and postfix in shard names?

ANSWER: ### Significance of '-' Prefix and Postfix in Shard Names
The '-' prefix and postfix in shard names have specific meanings:

* A '-' **prefix** means: anything less than the right value.
* A '-' **postfix** means: anything greater than or equal to the left value.
* A **plain '-'** denotes the full keyrange.

For example:
- `-80` means anything less than `0x80`.
- `80-` means anything greater than or equal to `0x80`.
- A plain `-` denotes the full keyrange, equivalent to `0-` or `-FF`. 

These conventions are used to define the range of values that belong to a particular shard, allowing Vitess to efficiently route queries and manage data distribution across the cluster.

| | version_tokens_session | CheckAndIgnore | **Related Vitess Documentation** * [VTGate](../vtgate) --- title: Replication Graph --- The *replication graph* identifies the relationships between primary databases and their respective replicas. During a failover, the replication graph enables Vitess to point all existing replicas to a newly designated primary database so that replication can continue. --- title: Shard --- A *shard* is a subset of a keyspace. A keyspace will always contain one or more shards. A shard typically contains one MySQL primary and potentially many MySQL replicas. Each MySQL instance within a shard has identical data (if we ignore any replication lag). The replicas can serve read-only traffic (with eventual consistency guarantees), execute long-running data analysis queries, or perform administrative tasks (backup, restore, diff, etc.). An *unsharded* keyspace is a keyspace with only a single shard. Vitess names the shard `0` (or sometimes `-`) by convention. When sharded, a keyspace has `N` shards with non-overlapping data. The number of shards in a keyspace can vary depending on the use-case and load characteristics, some Vitess users have hundreds of shards in some keyspaces. ## Shard Naming Shard names have the following characteristics: * They represent a range in unsigned integer space, where the left number is included, but the right is not. * Their notation is hexadecimal. * They are left justified, and right-padded with zeros. * A `-` prefix means: anything less than the right value. * A `-` postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. * A plain `-` denotes the full keyrange. Thus: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` == `0000000000000000-8000000000000000` `80-` is not the same as `80-FF`. This is why: `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range. `80-` means: ‘anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A `xxhash`

range, where the left number is included, but the right is not. - Their notation is hexadecimal. - They are left justified. - A - prefix means: anything less than the RHS value. - A - postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. - A plain - denotes the full keyrange. An example of a shard name is `-80` and following the rules above this means: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` Similarly `80-` is not the same as `80-FF` because `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range as `80-` means: ‘anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A hash vindex produces an 8-byte number. This means that all numbers less than `0x8000000000000000` will fall in shard `-80`. Any number with the highest bit set will be >= `0x8000000000000000`, and will therefore belong to shard `80-`. ## What does “/0” or “/-”mean? `0` or `-` indicates that the keyspace in question is unsharded. This means that a single shard covers the entire keyrange. Note that while both `0` and `-` are supported for legacy reasons, you can’t merge into shard `0` only `-`. For this and other reasons, it is recommended to use `-` instead of `0`. On the other hand a sharded cluster will have multiple keyranges, for example `-80` and `80-` if you have two shards. Note, that you can still manually target a single shard from your sharded cluster. You can read more about that [here](https://vitess.io/docs/faq/operating-vitess/queries/#can-i-address-a-specific-shard-if-i-want-to). --- title: VReplication weight: 2 --- ## How can Movetables be used with duplicate table names?

within any individual transaction. Enabling two-phase commit in Vitess to support cross-shard writes is possible, but will come at a significant performance cost. Whether that tradeoff is worth it differs from application to application and, generally speaking, adjusting the schema/workload is considered the better approach. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## Why do auto-increment columns not work in sharded Vitess? Auto-increment columns do not work very well for sharded tables. Vitess sequences solve this problem. Sequence tables must be specified in the VSchema and then tied to table columns. At the time of insert, if no value is specified for such a column, VTGate will generate a number for it using the sequence table. Vitess also supports sequence generators that can be used to generate new ids that work like MySQL auto increment columns. The VSchema allows you to associate table columns to sequence tables. ## What is resharding? How does it work? Vitess supports resharding, in which the number of shards is changed on a live cluster. This can be either splitting one or more shards into smaller pieces, or merging neighboring shards into bigger pieces. During resharding, the data in the source shards is copied into the destination shards, allowed to catch up on replication, and then compared against the original to ensure data integrity. Then the live serving infrastructure is shifted to the destination shards, and the source shards are deleted. ## How are shards named? Shard names have the following characteristics: - They represent a range, where the left number is included, but the right is not. - Their notation is hexadecimal. - They are left justified. - A - prefix means: anything less than the RHS value. - A - postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. - A plain
