QUESTION: Where can I find troubleshooting resources in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Troubleshooting Resources in Vitess

To find troubleshooting resources in Vitess, you can refer to the [Troubleshooting](../../configuration-advanced/reparenting) section. Additionally, the system provides various tools and commands to help with troubleshooting, such as:

* Checking the query serving path: `vtgate` -> `vttablet` -> `MySQL`
* Monitoring components: `vtgates`, `vttablets`, and `MySQL`
* Collecting information: logs, metrics, statistics, and configurations

You can also use commands like `TabletExternallyReparented` and `SetReadWrite` to resolve specific issues. For more information on these commands, you can refer to the [Vitess reference documentation](../../reference/programs/vtctl/tablets/#setreadwrite) and [Vitess reference documentation](../../reference/programs/vtctl/shards/#tabletexternallyreparented). 

It is recommended to set up monitoring for all components and collect as much information as possible when troubleshooting issues in your Vitess implementation.

graceful shut down. {{< /info >}} For more information, please refer to the [Reparenting](../../configuration-advanced/reparenting) section. {{< info >}} A reparenting operation can fail in the middle. If so, it is possible for the system to be in a situation where two vttablets report themselves as primary. If this happens, the one with the newer timestamp wins. The vtgates will automatically treat the newer primary as authoritative. The system will eventually heal itself because the vttablets use a registration protocol via the global topo and the older tablet will demote itself to a replica when it notices that it is no longer the primary. {{< /info >}} --- title: Troubleshooting weight: 17 --- ## Understanding the Components The secret to troubleshooting a Vitess cluster well comes from knowing how all the components are wired together. Of these connections, the most important one is the query serving path: * The application sends a request to a vtgate. * The vtgate forwards that request to one or more vttablets. * The vttablets in turn send the request to MySQL. If there is any kind of problem with serving queries, these are the components to drill into. VTGates and vttablets connect to the global and cell-specific toposerver. They use these toposervers to broadcast their state as well as to discover configuration changes. Additionally, vtgates receive health information from the vttablets they are connected to, and use this information to direct traffic in real-time. If there is any kind of problem with configuration, these are the areas to focus on. The first step to troubleshooting is to have an established baseline. It is recommended that monitoring is set up for all the components as directed in the monitoring section. When there is an incident, the change in the graphs will likely help with identifying the

can use this dump file to review these logs for any errors or issues. ## Collecting information for troubleshooting In order to troubleshoot issues occurring in your implementation of Vitess you will need to provide the community as much context as possible. When you reach out you should include, if possible, a summary/overview deployment document of what components are involved and how they interconnect, etc. Customers often maintain something like this for internal support purposes. Beyond the overview deployment document, we recommend that for the best experience, you collect as many of the items listed below as possible from production Vitess systems: - Logs (vtgate, vttablet, underlying MySQL) - Metrics (vtgate, vttablet, underlying MySQL) - Other statistics (MySQL processlist, MySQL InnoDB engine status, etc.) - Application DB pool configurations - Load balancer configurations (if in the MySQL connection path) - Historical load patterns --- title: Troubleshooting docs_nav_disable_expand: true weight: 4 ---

specific query is causing the problem. There are two approaches: * Inspect the `/queryz` page and look at the stats for all queries of that table. It is very likely that the problematic ones have already risen to the top of the page and may be color-coded red. If not, talking a few snapshots of the page and comparing the stats should help identify the problematic query. * Real-time stream from `/debug/querylog`, filtering out unwanted tables and observing the results to identify the problematic query. Once the query is identified, the remedy depends on the situation. It could be a rewrite of the query to be more efficient, the creation of an additional index, or it could be the shutdown of an abusive batch process. The above guidelines have not required you to inspect MySQL. Over time, Vitess has evolved by improving its observability every time there was an incident. However, there may still be situations where the above approach is insufficient. If so, you will need to resort to looking inside MySQL to find out the root cause. The actual identification of the root cause may not be as straightforward as described above. Sometimes, an incident is caused by multiple factors. In such cases, using first principles of troubleshooting and understanding how the components communicate with each other may be the only way to get to the bottom of a problem. If you have exhausted all the recommendations given so far and still have not found the root cause, you may have to directly troubleshoot the problem at the MySQL level. ### Elevated Error Rates The analysis for elevated error rates for read queries follows steps similar to elevated latency. You should essentially use the same drill down approach to identify the root cause. ### Transaction timeouts Transaction timeouts
