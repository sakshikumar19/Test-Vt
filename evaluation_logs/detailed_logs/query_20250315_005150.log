QUESTION: How do I manually target a specific shard in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Manually Targeting a Specific Shard in Vitess
To manually target a specific shard in Vitess, you can use **manual shard targeting**. 

According to the context, once you have determined the shard ID, you can use manual shard targeting to send a specific query to that shard. 

You can do this by using the primary Vindex column to query the Vindex and discover the shard ID. 

Note that if the query contains the primary Vindex column, or an appropriate secondary Vindex column, you do not need to do this, and **vtgate can route the query automatically**. 

For more information, you can refer to the [manual shard targeting](http://vitess.io/docs/faq/operating-vitess/queries/?#can-i-address-a-specific-shard-if-i-want-to) documentation.

- You need to prevent your SQL client from stripping the comments before sending to the server (the MySQL CLI strips comments by default) - You need to disable query normalization in vtgate (`--normalize_queries false`); to allow the comment to reach vttablet. - It only works for SELECT statements today, this might change in the future. {{< info >}} Note that streaming queries are not affected by either of these timeouts. {{< /info >}} ## Can I increase the resource pool timeout for streaming requests? Yes. You can adjust the vttablet flag for this. For example: `--queryserver-config-stream-pool-timeout=1s`. --- title: Operating Vitess docs_nav_disable_expand: true weight: 3 --- --- title: Advanced weight: 3 --- ## How can I know which shard contains a row for a table? You can use the primary Vindex column to query the Vindex and discover the shard ID. Once you have determined the shard ID you can use [manual shard targeting](http://vitess.io/docs/faq/operating-vitess/queries/?#can-i-address-a-specific-shard-if-i-want-to) to send that specific shard a query. Note that if the query contains the primary Vindex column, or an appropriate secondary Vindex column, you do not need to do this, and vtgate can route the query automatically. ## Can I use Vitess to do cross-shard JOINs or Transactions? A horizontal sharding solution for MySQL like Vitess does allow you to do both cross-shard joins and transactions, but just because you can doesn’t mean you should. A sharded architecture will perform best if you design it well and play to its strength, e.g. favoring single-shard targeted writes within any individual transaction. Enabling two-phase commit in Vitess to support cross-shard writes is possible, but will come at a significant performance cost. Whether that tradeoff is worth it differs from application to application and, generally speaking, adjusting the schema/workload is considered the better approach. --- title: Overview weight: 1

range, where the left number is included, but the right is not. - Their notation is hexadecimal. - They are left justified. - A - prefix means: anything less than the RHS value. - A - postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. - A plain - denotes the full keyrange. An example of a shard name is `-80` and following the rules above this means: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` Similarly `80-` is not the same as `80-FF` because `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range as `80-` means: ‘anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A hash vindex produces an 8-byte number. This means that all numbers less than `0x8000000000000000` will fall in shard `-80`. Any number with the highest bit set will be >= `0x8000000000000000`, and will therefore belong to shard `80-`. ## What does “/0” or “/-”mean? `0` or `-` indicates that the keyspace in question is unsharded. This means that a single shard covers the entire keyrange. Note that while both `0` and `-` are supported for legacy reasons, you can’t merge into shard `0` only `-`. For this and other reasons, it is recommended to use `-` instead of `0`. On the other hand a sharded cluster will have multiple keyranges, for example `-80` and `80-` if you have two shards. Note, that you can still manually target a single shard from your sharded cluster. You can read more about that [here](https://vitess.io/docs/faq/operating-vitess/queries/#can-i-address-a-specific-shard-if-i-want-to). --- title: VReplication weight: 2 --- ## How can Movetables be used with duplicate table names?

target keyspaces must have the exact same shard definitions - Query routing is all or nothing per shard, so you must *move all tables in the workflow that you wish to migrate* and you would use [`SwitchTraffic --tablet-types=RDONLY,REPLICA,PRIMARY`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_switchtraffic/) to switch *read and write traffic* all at once for the shard(s) - When the entire migration is complete, you cannot use the standard [`complete`](../../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_complete/) workflow action and the final cleanup step requires manual work: - The _reverse workflows should be [`cancel`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_cancel/)ed. This will clean up the both the global routing rules and the shard routing rules associated with the migration - Note: [`Workflow delete`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_workflow/vtctldclient_workflow_delete/) does not clean up the shard routing rules - You would need to perform any and all source side cleanup manually ## Related Vitess Flags In order to support the shard level query routing during the migration, the `--enable-partial-keyspace-migration` flag must be set for all of the [`vtgate`](../../programs/vtgate/) instances in the target Vitess cluster. {{< warning >}} This routing support has a performance impact for all traffic and thus you should only use this flag during the migration period and remove it once the migration is complete. {{< /warning >}} ## Related Commands You can view the current shard level routing rules in place using the [`GetShardRoutingRules`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_getshardroutingrules/) [`vtctldclient`](../../programs/vtctldclient/) command and you can save updated routing rules using the [`ApplyShardRoutingRules`](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_applyshardroutingrules/) command. --- title: Tablet Selection weight: 300 --- ### Introduction For both [VTGate VStreams and VTTablet VReplication streams](../../../concepts/vstream/) we must choose a tablet to serve the role of *source* (vstreamer). This tablet selection is performed by the internal `TabletPicker` component. {{< info >}} For VReplication streams a tablet also serves the role of *target* (vapplier). These, however, will always be the primary tablets in the target keyspace as we need to replicate the streamed writes within the target
