QUESTION: What is VReplication and how does it work?

ANSWER: ### VReplication Overview
VReplication is a building block for several features in Vitess, used for establishing replication from a source keyspace/shard into a target keyspace/shard. It works as a stream or combination of streams that can replicate multiple tables.

### How VReplication Works
The process involves the following steps:

1. **Analyzing the source table**: Identifies the rows that need to be copied from the source table on the source shard.
2. **Locking and recording GTID**: Briefly locks the table, records the current GTID replication position on the source database, and then unlocks the table.
3. **Selecting and copying rows**: Selects all rows and columns that match a specified filter from GTID value 0 onward and makes a copy of the results.
4. **Streaming the copy**: Streams the copy over to the target shard to start inserting rows.
5. **Handling incomplete copying**: If the copying phase doesn't finish within a specified time (default 1 hour), it stops and goes back to the table to pick up any changes made since it started copying.
6. **Filtering events**: Determines what events have occurred after the initial select and copy by comparing the GTID at the start and end of the copying phase.
7. **Filtering and replicating events**: Filters out events that don't pertain to the target and replicates the relevant events.

VReplication also supports features like **journaling** (saving binlog positions for resuming replication) and works with **routing rules** to manage query routing based on workflow type. Additionally, it has capabilities like **fast replay** (batching transactions to catch up with backlogs) and **accurate lag tracking** (sending current time with every event).

It is defined in go/vt/topo/helpers/tee.go. It allows communicating to two topo services, and the migration uses multiple phases. This process is explained in Vitess’ documentation [here](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/topology-service/#migration-using-the-tee-implementation). --- title: VReplication weight: 6 --- ## What is VReplication? How does it work? VReplication is used as a building block for a number of features in Vitess. It works as a stream or combination of streams that establish replication from a source keyspace/shard into a target keyspace/shard. A given stream can replicate multiple tables. It allows Vitess to keep the data being copied in-sync by using a combination of copying rows and filtered replication. VReplication works via the following process: 1. It first analyzes the source table on the source shard and identifies what rows it needs to copy. 2. It then very briefly locks the table and records the current GTID replication position on the source database. After recording the current GTID position, VReplication then unlocks the table again. 3. It selects all rows and columns that match a specified filter from GTID value 0 onward and makes a copy of the results. 4. It then streams the copy over to the target shard to start inserting rows. VReplication will keep copying for a specified period of time (default 1 hour), to attempt to finish the copy. 5. If the copying phase on the target hasn’t finished in an hour, it will stop and go back to the table in order to pick up any changes that have been made since it started copying. 6. It knows what the GTID was when it started copying and what the GTID is now. This enables it to determine what events have occurred after it performed the first select and copy. 7. It will then filter out all the events except the ones that pertain

target and comparing them against each other. * Journaling: If there is any kind of traffic cut-over where we start writing to a different table than we used to before, VReplication will save the current binlog positions into a journal table. This can be used by other streams to resume replication from the new source. * Routing rules: Although this feature is itself not a direct functionality of VReplication, it works hand in hand with it. It automatically manages sophisticated rules about where to route queries depending on the type of workflow being performed. For example, it is used to control the cut-over during [`MoveTables`](../movetables/). <a name="exec"></a> ## Other Properties of VReplication ### Fast Replay VReplication has the capability to batch transactions if the send rate of the source exceeds the replay rate of the destination. This allows it to catch up very quickly when there is a backlog. Load tests have shown a 3-20X improvement over traditional MySQL replication depending on the workload. ### Accurate Lag Tracking The source [`VTTablet`](../../../concepts/vtgate/) sends its current time along with every event. This allows the target to correct for clock skew while estimating replication lag. Additionally, the source starts sending heartbeats if there is nothing to send. If the target receives no events from the source at all, it knows that it's definitely lagged and starts reporting itself accordingly. ### Self-Replication VReplication allows you to set the source keyspace/shard to be the same as the target. This is especially useful for performing schema rollouts: you can create the target table with the intended schema and vreplicate from the source table to the new target. Once caught up, you can cutover to write to the target table. In this situation, an apply on the target generates a binlog event that will be picked up

hosted MySQL like RDS on AWS, CloudSQL on GCP, or Azure managed MySQL, because you are not coming from MySQL you have to use either the ‘Stop-the-world’ method or the method using VReplication setup in front of the existing external database. You can read more about those two methods [here](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/migration/migrate-data/). There is no option to do an application level migration. The biggest challenge with this sort of migration is you must be able to access the source database from the location where you want to put the target database. You will need to ensure this configuration constraint is resolved and set up prior to any sort of migration. ## What is Vstream and how does it work? VStream is a change notification service accessible via VTGate. The purpose of VStream is to provide equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards. gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, can subscribe to a VStream to receive change events from other shards. The VStream pulls events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This allows for efficient execution of functions such as VReplication where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards, and then apply it to a target instance. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## How do I migrate my data to Vitess? There are two main parts to migrating your data to Vitess: migrating the actual data and repointing the application. The answer here will focus primarily on the methods that can be used to migrate your data into Vitess. There are three different methods to migrate your data into Vitess. Choosing the appropriate option depends on several factors like:
