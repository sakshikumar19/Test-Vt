QUESTION: What are the differences between TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS) and username/password authentication in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Differences between TLS Client Certificate Authentication (mTLS) and Username/Password Authentication in Vitess

The main differences between TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS) and username/password authentication in Vitess are:

* **Authentication Method**:
	+ TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS): uses a client certificate to authenticate the client.
	+ Username/password authentication: uses a username and password to authenticate the client.
* **Protocol Support**:
	+ TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS): supported by all protocols (MySQL, gRPC, HTTP).
	+ Username/password authentication: only supported by the MySQL protocol.
* **Security**:
	+ TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS): considered more secure as it uses mutual authentication and eliminates the need to transmit passwords.
	+ Username/password authentication: less secure as it relies on password transmission and may be vulnerable to password cracking or eavesdropping.

In summary, TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS) is a more secure and versatile authentication method, while username/password authentication is limited to the MySQL protocol and may be less secure.

the data, meta-data and control paths enumerated above, they use one of three protocols: * MySQL binary protocol * gRPC (using HTTP/2 as transport) * HTTP ## Encryption All three the protocol types above use TLS in one form or another to encrypt communications. Therefore the basics around encrypting a specific client to server communication is straightforward: * Server-side: * Generate a CA private key and cert as the root for your certificate hierarchy. * (optionally) Generate intermediate keys to serve as signing keys for your server certificates. We will not cover this case in this document. * Generate a private key for the server component involved. * Generate a CSR using the private key. * Use the CA key material and the CSR to generate/sign the server certificate. * Install the server cert and private key using the appropriate Vitess options for the component in question. * If required, adjust other Vitess component options to enforce/require TLS-only communications. ## Server authentication In addition to encrypting the connection, you may want or need to configure client-side server authentication. This is the process by which the client verifies that the server it is trying to establish a TLS connection to is who they claim to be, and not an imposter or man-in-the-middle. We achieve this by: * Client-side: * Install the CA cert used by your certificate issuing process to sign the server component certificates. * Adjust the Vitess client component options to verify the server certificate using the installed CA cert. This would typically involve specifying the CA cert, as well as the server or common name to expect from the server component, if it isn't the same as the DNS name (or has an IP SAN configured). ## Client authentication Client authentication in Vitess can take two forms, depending on the protocol in question: * TLS client certificate authentication (also known as mTLS) * Username/password authentication; this is only an option for the connections involving the MySQL protocol. ## Walkthroughs We will now cover how to setup the various TLS component combinations. We will start with the data path, then move on to the control paths. We will handle [encryption](#encryption) and [server authentication](#server-authentication) together, and then handle [client authentication](#client-authentication) separately. ### Certificate generation As discussed above, large organizations will often have established tools to secure a TLS certificate hierarchy and issue certificates. For the purpose of these walkthroughs, we could use bare `openssl` commands to step through every detail. However, since we consider this an implementation detail that is likely to vary from user to user, we will leverage a shell-script-based tool called [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) that uses `openssl` under the covers, and hides much of the complexity. This tool has been around for many years as part of the OpenVPN project, and can perform all the steps to setup a CA, generate server certificates and also client certificates if desired. Since `easy-rsa` is just a set of shell scripts, if you require a closer understanding of how every step works,

Your new CA certificate file for publishing is at: /home/user/CA/pki/ca.crt ``` Your CA is now configured and you should be able to generate certs easily now. ### Application to vtgate While applications can connect to vtgate using gRPC, the vast majority of Vitess users only use the MySQL protocol. When using the MySQL protocol, most users will use username/password for client authentication, although it is also possible to configure TLS client certificate authentication. We will assume the use of username/password authentication. For each vtgate you should generate a server private key and certificate. We will do this in two steps: - First we generate a private key and certificate request. - We will then use the CA to sign that request to produce the server certificate. For the the prompts during `gen-req`, you can just hit enter. You will be prompted to type `yes` and enter the CA password during the `sign-req` phase. ```bash $ cd ~/CA/ $ ./easyrsa gen-req vtgate1 nopass Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: /home/user/CA/vars Using SSL: openssl OpenSSL 1.1.1g FIPS 21 Apr 2020 Generating a RSA private key ............................+++++ writing new private key to '/home/user/CA/pki/easy-rsa-178308.W6uc3G/tmp.Iqlvgf' ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.

`ZooKeeper`. It should be noted that regardless of the implementation, no sensitive data is stored in the Vitess topology server, i.e.: * No data (queries/results) is stored in, or flows through, the topology server. * No secrets (keys, certificates, passwords) are stored in the toplogy server data store. * Only metadata (VSchema, keyspace and shard information) is stored in the topology server data store. ### Configuring etcd for secure connections We will not cover setting up `etcd` with certificates in this guide. You can consult the `etcd` documenation [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/security/). Note that you can use `easy-rsa` as above to generate your server private key and certificate pairs. If you do not require client authentication, that is sufficient, and you then just have to distribute your CA certificate (`/home/user/CA/pki/ca.crt` in the examples above) to your clients, and proceed as in the next section. ### Configuring secure connectivity between vtgate/vttablet/vtctld and etcd The Vitess servers (vtgate/vttablet/vtctld) share the same set of parameters to connect via TLS to `etcd`: * `--topo_etcd_tls_ca` : Path to the PEM certificate used to authenticate the TLS CA certificate presented by the `etcd` server. Enables TLS to `etcd` if present. * `--topo_etcd_tls_cert` : Path to a PEM client certificate (mTLS) used to authenticate this client to the `etcd` server. Only necessary if your `etcd` server requires client authentication. * `--topo_etcd_tls_key` : Path to a PEM private key used for signing the client certificate (mTLS) exchange with the `etcd` server. Only necessary if your `etcd` server requires client authentication. As is necessary for your design/architecture, add one or more of the above options to your vtgate, vttablet and vtctld instances. ### Configuring etcd for secure connections We will just mention the basic flags here for getting `etcd` to accept encrypted client connections. We will not cover the flags to make sure that communication between `etcd` cluster members (peers) are encrypted. Flags: * `--listen-client-urls`: specify an `https://` host and port prefix * `--advertise-client-urls`: specify an `https://` host and port prefix * `--cert-file`: Point to to a server cert PEM file * `--key-file`: Point to to a server key PEM file * (optional) `--cipher-suites`: Can be used to limit the cipher suites the etc server will negotiate (e.g. `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` is a popular combination). Note that the Vitess client components will negotiate any of the standard golang TLS client cipher suites (which can vary somewhat depending on which golang version Vitess was compiled with, and what libraries are available on the platform). It is not possible to limit the cipher suites from the etcd client (i.e. Vitess) components. It is also possible to configure `etcd` to require/verify client certificates from the clients; for that use the `--trusted-ca-file` option to point to the PEM CA cert that the client certs are signed with. ### Configuring ZooKeeper for secure connections We will not cover setting up `Zookeeper` with certificates in this guide. You can consult the `Zookeeper` documenation [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ZooKeeper+SSL+User+Guide), specifically the `Server` section. Note that you can use `easy-rsa` as above to generate your server

Cipher in use is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 Current pager: stdout Using outfile: '' Using delimiter: ; Server version: 5.7.9-Vitess MySQL Community Server - GPL Protocol version: 10 Connection: 127.0.0.1 via TCP/IP . . ``` The above MySQL CLI output shows that the connection is encrypted, and that the server (vtgate) was successfully validated using the CA certificate. If the server certificate could not be validated using the CA certificate, an error similar to this would have been seen: ``` ERROR 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed ``` If TLS was not setup on the vtgate at all, an error like this could have resulted: ``` ERROR 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error: SSL is required but the server doesn't support it ``` ### vttablet to MySQL A common Vitess deployment model is to co-locate vttablet and MySQL on the same host/VM/container. In a case like this, vttablet connectivity to MySQL will be via local unix socket or TCP connection on localhost. It is unnecessary to configure encryption between vttablet and MySQL in this case, since the traffic never leaves the local machine/VM. However, in some deployment models vttablet and MySQL are running on different hosts, and you may want vttablet to use TLS to speak to MySQL. We will not cover configuring MySQL to use TLS certificates extensively here, just the minimum. Please consult the MySQL documentation for further information. Again, we will also assume that vttablet will be using MySQL username/password client authentication. Note that when you are configuring TLS and MySQL you will need to be aware of what TLS versions are supported. You may be using an [older version of MySQL that does not have TLS 1.2 support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.SSLSupport). If you need to support pre 1.2 TLS [vtgate supports ](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/de7f133dbe2dd6a7910f13c682910a4f5c0ac0df/go/vt/vtgate/plugin_mysql_server.go#L67)that setting using `--mysql_server_tls_min_version` and vttablet supports that setting using `--db_tls_min_version=TLSv1.1` Generate a server certificate for our MySQL instance using our CA: ```bash $ cd ~/CA/ $ ./easyrsa gen-req mysql1 nopass . . . Keypair and certificate request completed. Your files are: req: /home/user/CA/pki/reqs/mysql1.req key: /home/user/CA/pki/private/mysql1.key $ ./easyrsa sign-req server mysql1 . . . Write out database with 1 new entries Data Base Updated Certificate created at: /home/user/CA/pki/issued/mysql1.crt ``` Copy the files `/home/user/CA/pki/private/mysql1.key` and `/home/user/CA/pki/issued/mysql1.crt` to the MySQL server in the appropriate locations, securing their ownership and permissions appropriately. Configure the MySQL server options `ssl-key` and `ssl-cert` appropriately to point to where you placed the private key and certificate above. You can read more about it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/8.0/en/using-encrypted-connections.html) Note that these options do not require clients to use TLS, but is optional. If you need to require all TCP/IP clients to use TLS, you can use the MySQL server option `require_secure_transport`, or you can enforce it on a per MySQL user basis by using the `REQUIRE SSL` option when creating or altering a MySQL-level user. See the MySQL documentation for details. Restart your MySQL server to make these MySQL server option configuration changes active. Now, configure vttablet to connect to MySQL using the necessary parameters, verifying the CA certificate: ```bash
