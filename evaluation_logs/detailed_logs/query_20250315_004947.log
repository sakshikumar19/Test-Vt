QUESTION: What is resharding, and how does it work in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Resharding in Vitess
Resharding in Vitess refers to the process of changing the number of shards in a live cluster. This can be done by either:
* Splitting one or more shards into smaller pieces
* Merging neighboring shards into bigger pieces

The resharding process works as follows:
1. The data in the source shards is copied into the destination shards.
2. The destination shards are allowed to catch up on replication.
3. The data in the destination shards is compared against the original to ensure data integrity.
4. Once the data integrity is verified, the live serving infrastructure is shifted to the destination shards.
5. Finally, the source shards are deleted.

This process allows Vitess to dynamically adjust the sharding configuration of a cluster in response to changing workload or performance requirements. However, operations like resharding are only possible with Vitess-managed MySQL servers.

within any individual transaction. Enabling two-phase commit in Vitess to support cross-shard writes is possible, but will come at a significant performance cost. Whether that tradeoff is worth it differs from application to application and, generally speaking, adjusting the schema/workload is considered the better approach. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## Why do auto-increment columns not work in sharded Vitess? Auto-increment columns do not work very well for sharded tables. Vitess sequences solve this problem. Sequence tables must be specified in the VSchema and then tied to table columns. At the time of insert, if no value is specified for such a column, VTGate will generate a number for it using the sequence table. Vitess also supports sequence generators that can be used to generate new ids that work like MySQL auto increment columns. The VSchema allows you to associate table columns to sequence tables. ## What is resharding? How does it work? Vitess supports resharding, in which the number of shards is changed on a live cluster. This can be either splitting one or more shards into smaller pieces, or merging neighboring shards into bigger pieces. During resharding, the data in the source shards is copied into the destination shards, allowed to catch up on replication, and then compared against the original to ensure data integrity. Then the live serving infrastructure is shifted to the destination shards, and the source shards are deleted. ## How are shards named? Shard names have the following characteristics: - They represent a range, where the left number is included, but the right is not. - Their notation is hexadecimal. - They are left justified. - A - prefix means: anything less than the RHS value. - A - postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. - A plain

of a VTTablet process and a MySQL process is called a Tablet. Please note that in some cases VTTablets may be deployed as [unmanaged/remote or partially managed](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/programs/vttablet/#managed-mysql). The recommendation is to start with unmanaged mode but eventually migrate to managed mode. Operations like resharding are possible only with vitess-managed MySQL servers. ## What is VTCtld? VTCtld is a Vitess server component that can perform various Vitess cluster- and component-level operations on behalf of an administrative user. You can interact with VTCtld via a web UI, or via an gRPC interface using the vtctldclient CLI tool. It has an administrative UI called VTAdmin. Some of the administrative actions VTCtld can perform include: reparents (failovers), backups, shard splits, resharding, and shard merges. ## What is a keyspace? A keyspace is a logical database. Typically, a keyspace maps to multiple MySQL instances regardless of sharding. This is because it is recommended to run multiple replicas even for an unsharded keyspace. In other words, a keyspace appears as a single database from the application's viewpoint. Reading data from a keyspace is just like reading from a MySQL database. ## What is vtctldclient? This is a Vitess CLI used to execute gRPC commands against VTCtld. It is the most common way to perform administrative commands against a running Vitess cluster. ## What is a cell? How does it work? A cell is a group of servers and associated network infrastructure co-located in an area, and isolated from failures in other cells. It is typically either a full data center or a subset of a data center, sometimes called a zone or availability zone. Vitess gracefully handles cell-level failures, such as when a cell is isolated from other cells by a network failure. A useful way to think of a cell is as a failure domain.

A plain `-` denotes the full keyrange. Thus: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` == `0000000000000000-8000000000000000` `80-` is not the same as `80-FF`. This is why: `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range. `80-` means: â€˜anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A `xxhash` type vindex produces an unsigned 64 bit integer as output. This means that all integers **less** than `0x8000000000000000` will fall in shard `-80`. Any number with the highest bit set will be >= `0x8000000000000000`, and will therefore belong to shard `80-`. This left-justified approach allows you to have keyspace ids of arbitrary length. However, the most significant bits are the ones on the left. For example an `md5` hash produces 16 bytes. That can also be used as a keyspace id. A `varbinary` of arbitrary length can also be mapped as is to a keyspace id. This is what the `binary` vindex does. ## Resharding Vitess supports [resharding](../../user-guides/configuration-advanced/resharding), in which the number of shards is changed on a live cluster. This can be either splitting one or more shards into smaller pieces, or merging neighboring shards into bigger pieces. During resharding, the data in the source shards is copied into the destination shards, allowed to catch up on replication, and then compared against the original to ensure data integrity. Then the live serving infrastructure is shifted to the destination shards, and the source shards are deleted. **Related Vitess Documentation** * [Resharding User Guide](../../user-guides/configuration-advanced/resharding) --- title: Tablet --- A *tablet* is a combination of a `mysqld` process and a corresponding `vttablet` process, usually running on the same machine. Each tablet is assigned a *tablet type*, which specifies what role it currently performs. Queries are routed to a tablet via a [VTGate](../vtgate) server. ## Tablet Types See the user guide [VTTablet Modes](../../user-guides/configuration-basic/vttablet-mysql/)
