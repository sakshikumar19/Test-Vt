QUESTION: How do I integrate Prometheus with Vitess for monitoring?

ANSWER: ### Integrating Prometheus with Vitess for Monitoring
To integrate Prometheus with Vitess for monitoring, you can use the Prometheus exporter that is enabled by default in Vitess. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Ensure Prometheus Exporter is Enabled**: The Prometheus exporter is enabled by default in Vitess. You can verify this by checking the Vitess configuration.
2. **Configure Prometheus to Scrape Vitess Metrics**: Configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics from Vitess by adding a scrape configuration to your Prometheus configuration file. The metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint of each Vitess component.
3. **Specify the Scrape Interval**: Specify the scrape interval to control how often Prometheus scrapes the metrics from Vitess.
4. **Verify Metrics are Being Collected**: Verify that the metrics are being collected by Prometheus by checking the Prometheus web interface.

#### Example Scrape Configuration:
```yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'vitess'
    scrape_interval: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['vtgate:15001', 'vttablet:15002']
```
In this example, Prometheus will scrape the metrics from the `vtgate` and `vttablet` components every 10 seconds.

#### Using Vitess Operator on Kubernetes:
If you are running Vitess on Kubernetes using the Vitess Operator, you can have Prometheus or a Prometheus-compatible agent running in your Kubernetes cluster to scrape the metrics from Vitess automatically.

Note: For more detailed information on integrating Prometheus with Vitess, you can refer to the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) and the [Vitess documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/).

and type. * HealthcheckConnections - It shows the number of tablet connections for query/healthcheck per keyspace, shard, and tablet type. There are two other pages you can use to get monitoring information from Vitess in the VTGate web UI: * `/debug/query_plans` - This URL gives you all the query plans for queries going through VTGate. * `/debug/vschema` - This URL shows the VSchema as loaded by VTGate. VTTablet has a similar web UI. Vitess component metrics can also be scraped via /metrics. This will provide a Prometheus-format metric dump that is updated continuously. This is the recommended way to collect metrics from Vitess. ## How do you integrate Prometheus and Vitess? There is an Prometheus exporter that is on by default that enables you to configure a Prometheus compatible scraper to grab data from the various Vitess components. All Vitess components export their metrics on their http port at `/metrics`. If your Vitess configuration includes running the Vitess Operator on Kubernetes, then you can have Prometheus or a Prometheus compatible agent running in your Kubernetes cluster. This would then scrape the metrics from Vitess automatically, as it would be run on the ports advertised and on our standard `/metrics` page. You can read more about getting the metrics into Prometheus [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config). --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## What is Vitess? **Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of database instances.** It is architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many SQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database. Vitess can help you with the following problems: * Scaling a SQL database by allowing you to shard it, while keeping your application changes to a minimum. * Migrating from

the data into the new cell. There are use cases where you may want to experimentally deploy changes to only some cells. Separating information from the global topo and local cells makes those experiments possible without affecting the entire deployment. Tools like [vtgate](../../../reference/programs/vtgate) and [vttablet](../../../reference/programs/vttablet) consume information from the local copy of the topo. An unsharded keyspace typically has a single shard named `0` or` -`. A sharded keyspace has shards named after the keyranges assigned to it, like `-80` and `80-`. Please refer to the section on [shard naming](../../../concepts/shard/#shard-naming) for more info on how shards are named. --- title: Monitoring weight: 16 aliases: ['/docs/launching/server-configuration/', '/docs/user-guides/server-configuration/', '/docs/user-guides/configuring-components/'] --- This section describes how to monitor Vitess components. Additionally, we recommend that you also add the necessary monitoring and alerting for the TopoServers as well as the MySQL instances running with each vttablet. ## Tools Vitess provides integrations with a variety of popular monitoring tools: Prometheus, InfluxDB and Datadog. The core infrastructure uses go's `expvar` package to export real-time variables visible as a JSON object served by the `/debug/vars` URL. The exported variables are CamelCase names. These names are algorithmically converted to the appropriate naming standards for each monitoring tool. For example, Prometheus uses a [snake case conversion algorithm](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/e259a08f017d9f1b5984fcaac5c54e26d1c7c31d/go/stats/prometheusbackend/prometheusbackend.go#L95-L116). In this case, the Prometheus exporter would convert the `Queries.Histograms.Select.500000` variable to `vttablet_queries_bucket{plan_type="Select",le="0.0005"}`. In the sections below, we will be describing the variables as seen in the `/debug/vars` page. The two critical Vitess processes to monitor are vttablet and vtgate. Additionally, we recommend that you setup monitoring for the underlying MySQL instances as commonly recommended in the MySQL community. Beyond what the tools export, it is important to also monitor system resource usage: CPU, memory, network and disk usage. Beyond the monitoring variables, the Vitess processes export additional information about their status on

purging. --- title: Monitoring weight: 8 --- # Current state of monitoring There are currently three main ways that a Vitess cluster can be monitored. Depending on your needs, you can use any of the following methods: ## 1. Vitess status pages The status HTML pages of various Vitess components can be accessed by pointing your browser to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/status`. The status pages will often display some basic, but useful, information for monitoring. For example, the status page of a vttablet will show the QPS graph for the past few minutes. Viewing a status page can be useful since it works out of the box, but it only provides very basic monitoring capabilities. ## 2. Pull-based metrics system Vitess uses Goâ€™s [expvar package](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/) to expose various metrics, with the expectation that a user can configure a pull-based metrics system to ingest those metrics. Metrics are published to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/vars` as JSON key-value pairs, which should be easy for any metrics system to parse. Scraping Vitess variables is a good way to integrate Vitess into an existing monitoring system, and is useful for building up detailed monitoring dashboards. It is also the officially supported way for monitoring Vitess. ## 3. Push-based metrics system Vitess also includes support for push-based metrics systems via plug-ins. Each Vitess component would need to be run with the `--emit_stats` flag. By default, the stats_emit_period is 60s, so each component will push stats to the selected backend every minute. This is configurable via the `--stats_emit_period` flag. Vitess has preliminary plug-ins to support OpenTSDB as a push-based metrics backend. It should be fairly straightforward to write your own plug-in, if you want to support a different backend. The plug-in package simply needs to implement the `PushBackend` interface of the `stats` package. For an example, you can see the [OpenTSDB plugin](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/stats/opentsdb/opentsdb.go).
