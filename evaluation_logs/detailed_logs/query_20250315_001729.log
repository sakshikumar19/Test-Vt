QUESTION: How do I handle failovers in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Handling Failovers in Vitess
To handle failovers in Vitess, you can use the built-in buffering mechanism. Buffering allows Vitess to queue writes to a shard that is currently unavailable due to a failover. Here are the steps to handle failovers:

#### Enabling Buffering
To enable buffering, you need to start Vitess with the `--enable_buffer=true` flag.

#### Configuring Buffering
You can configure buffering using the following flags:
* `--buffer_max_failover_duration`: Stop buffering completely if a failover takes longer than this duration. (default 20s)
* `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers`: Minimum time between the end of a failover and the start of the next one (tracked per shard). Faster consecutive failovers will not trigger buffering. (default 1m0s)
* `--buffer_size`: Maximum number of buffered requests in flight (across all ongoing failovers). (default 1000)
* `--buffer_window`: Duration for how long a request should be buffered at most. (default 10s)

#### Example
To enable buffering with a maximum failover duration of 30 seconds, a minimum time between failovers of 2 minutes, a buffer size of 2000, and a buffer window of 15 seconds, you can use the following flags:
```bash
--enable_buffer=true --buffer_max_failover_duration=30s --buffer_min_time_between_failovers=2m --buffer_size=2000 --buffer_window=15s
```
Note that the exact configuration may vary depending on your specific use case and Vitess setup. It's recommended to consult the Vitess documentation and seek guidance from a Vitess expert before configuring buffering for failovers.

Everything you need to know about scaling MySQL with Vitess. notoc: true cascade: version: v22.0 weight: 78 --- --- title: Cell description: Data center, availability zone or group of computing resources --- A *cell* is a group of servers and network infrastructure collocated in an area, and isolated from failures in other cells. It is typically either a full data center or a subset of a data center, sometimes called a *zone* or *availability zone*. Vitess gracefully handles cell-level failures, such as when a cell is cut off the network. Each cell in a Vitess implementation has a [local topology service](../topology-service), which is hosted in that cell. The topology service contains most of the information about the Vitess tablets in its cell. This enables a cell to be taken down and rebuilt as a unit. Vitess limits cross-cell traffic for both data and metadata. While it may be useful to also have the ability to route read traffic to individual cells, Vitess currently serves reads only from the local cell. Writes will go cross-cell when necessary, to wherever the primary for that shard resides. --- title: Execution Plans --- Vitess parses queries at both the VTGate and VTTablet layer in order to evaluate the best method to execute a query. This evaluation is known as query planning, and results in a _query execution plan_. The Execution Plan is dependent on both the query and the associated [VSchema](../vschema). One of the underlying goals of Vitess' planning strategy is to push down as much work as possible to the underlying MySQL instances. When this is not possible, Vitess will use a plan that collects input from multiple sources and merges the results to produce the correct query result. ### Evaluation Model An

A Vitess [cell](../../../concepts/cell) is a logical grouping of servers that typically maps to an availability zone, region, or data center. The purpose of a cell is to provide isolation. The loss of one cell should not disrupt other cells. To fulfil this, Vitess allows you to configure separate cell-specific topo servers. There is no need to distribute the servers of a cell-specific toposerver to other cells. However, it is recommended that you bring up more than one instance in order to survive individual server failures. Even if you do not want a multi-cell deployment, you still need to create at least one cell before bringing up the rest of the Vitess servers. If you do not plan to deploy multiple cells, you can reuse the global toposerver as the cell-specific one also. You can use the `vtctldclient` alias to create one: ```sh vtctldclient AddCellInfo \ --root /vitess/cell1 \ --server-address <cell_topo_address> \ cell1 ``` Note that the cell topo has its own root path. If reusing the same toposerver, you must ensure that they donâ€™t overlap. The cell information is saved in the global toposerver. Vitess takes care of deploying the necessary information from the global topo to the cell-specific topos. Vitess binaries fetch the cell information from the global topo before switching to use the cell topo. {{< info >}} You will only need to specify the topo global root for launching the Vitess servers. The cell-specific information including its root path will be automatically loaded from the cell info. {{< /info >}} ## Mapping cells to zones and regions Most public clouds offer a hierarchy of failure boundaries. Regions are data centers that are far apart. Depending on the distance, the latency between two regions can be in the 10s to 100s of milliseconds. Zones are partitions within a
