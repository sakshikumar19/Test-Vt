QUESTION: What are the main components of Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Main Components of Vitess
The main components of Vitess are:
* **VTGate**: 
* **Topology server (etcd)**: The topology service in Vitess, which provides a distributed locking service and stores topology data.
* **VTCtld**: 
* **Tablets**: Made up of VTTablets and mysqld, which are the basic units of a Vitess cluster.

These components work together to provide a scalable and highly available database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.

regular backups in order to migrate out of Vitess. This method is performed directly on the tablet servers and is more efficient and safer for databases of any significant size. The downside is that this is a physical MySQL instance backup, and needs to be restored accordingly. Both mysqldump and go-mydumper are not typically suitable for production backups. This is because Vitess does not implement all the locking constructs across a sharded database that are necessary to do a consistent logical backup while writing to the database. However, it may be appropriate if you are able to stop all writes to Vitess for the period that the dump process is running; or you are just backing up tables that are not receiving any writes. You can read more about exporting data from Vitess [here](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/exporting-data/). ## How do Vitess replicas stay in sync? Do replicas use VReplication? Every shard in Vitess uses normal MySQL replication to replicate changes from the primary for that shard to the replica(s). Vitess can use asynchronous MySQL replication (the default), but can also be configured to use semi-synchronous MySQL replication in order to provide data durability in the presence of failures. VReplication is used internally in Vitess for features like resharding, migrating tables across keyspaces, and materialized views. It is not used directly to keep replicas in sync with a primary. ## What are the main components of Vitess? Vitess consists of a number of server processes and command-line utilities and is backed by a consistent metadata store.

It’s better to think of microservices as a design principle rather than as a scaling trick. This architecture is more tailored to improving resilience and flexibility for deployment, by breaking up monolithic deployments into more loosely coupled, isolated elements. The complexity of managing resources for horizontal sharding aligns closely with the challenges of managing resources in a microservices architecture. Because of this added management complexity, Vitess is a good fit for a container orchestration environment to offset some of this additional complexity. Vitess is commonly deployed/managed in containers using the Vitess Operator for Kubernetes. In short, horizontally scaling MySQL is made possible by Vitess, both in microservices architectures, as well as more traditional environments. It is not unusual for a well-configured single-server MySQL installation to serve hundreds of thousands of queries per second, so keep in mind that any scaling challenges you might face could also be resolved by optimizing your code, queries, schema and/or MySQL configuration. One common challenge faced by users implementing a large-scale microservices architecture, while still keeping a unified database architecture, is that the number of MySQL protocol client connections to the central database can become overwhelming, even with client-side connection pooling. Vitess handles this by effectively introducing additional layers of connection pooling, ensuring that the backend MySQL instances are not overwhelmed. --- title: Topology weight: 4 --- ## What is the topology service? How does it work? The Topology Service is a set of backend processes. This service is exposed to all Vitess components. It delivers

as long as the upstream MySQL instance the replica is connecting to has been configured correctly to support TLS MySQL protocol connections (see above). ## vttablet data and control paths In Vitess, communication between vtgate and vttablet instances are via gRPC. gRPC uses HTTP/2 as a transport protocol, but by default this is not encrypted in Vitess. To secure this data path you need to, at a minimum, configure TLS for gRPC on the server (vttablet) side. Other components, as detailed above, also connect to vttablet via gRPC. After configuring vttablet gRPC for TLS, you will need to configure all these components (vtgate, other vttablets, vtctld) explicitly to connect using TLS to vttablet via gRPC, or you will have a partially or wholly non-functional system. #### vtgate to vttablet First, generate a certificate for use by vttablet: ```bash $ cd ~/CA/ $ ./easyrsa gen-req vttablet1 nopass Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: /home/user/CA/vars Using SSL: openssl OpenSSL 1.1.1g FIPS 21 Apr 2020 Generating a RSA private key ..................................+++++ .....+++++ writing new private key to '/home/user/CA/pki/easy-rsa-209692.tdDNNt/tmp.hwhw8x' ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name (2 letter code) [US]: State or Province Name (full name) [California]: Locality Name (eg, city) [Mountain View]: Organization Name (eg, company) [PlanetScale Inc]: Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [Operations]: Common Name (eg: your user, host, or server name) [vttablet1]: Email Address [carequest@planetscale.com]: Keypair and certificate request completed.
