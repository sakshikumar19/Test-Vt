QUESTION: What are the key differences between Vitess and traditional MySQL in terms of scalability and transaction management?

ANSWER: ### Key Differences between Vitess and Traditional MySQL
Vitess and traditional MySQL differ significantly in terms of scalability and transaction management. The key differences are:

#### Scalability
* **Horizontal scaling**: Vitess is designed to scale horizontally, allowing it to handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to the cluster. In contrast, traditional MySQL is typically scaled vertically, which can become limited by the capacity of a single server.
* **Sharding**: Vitess uses sharding to distribute data across multiple servers, making it possible to handle large datasets and high traffic volumes. Traditional MySQL does not have built-in sharding capabilities.

#### Transaction Management
* **Distributed transactions**: Vitess supports distributed transactions, which allow multiple servers to participate in a single transaction. This enables Vitess to handle complex transactions that span multiple servers. Traditional MySQL does not have built-in support for distributed transactions.
* **Transactional messaging**: Vitess provides transactional messaging, which allows messages to be created or acknowledged as part of an existing transaction. This ensures that messages are delivered reliably and consistently, even in the presence of failures. Traditional MySQL does not have a built-in messaging system.

#### Other differences
* **Guaranteed delivery**: Vitess provides guaranteed delivery of messages, which ensures that messages are delivered reliably and consistently. Traditional MySQL does not have a built-in messaging system with guaranteed delivery.
* **Non-blocking**: Vitess is designed to be non-blocking, which means that it can continue to accept new messages even if the sending is backlogged. Traditional MySQL does not have a built-in messaging system with non-blocking capabilities.

Overall, Vitess is designed to handle large-scale, distributed databases with high traffic volumes, while traditional MySQL is better suited for smaller-scale, single-server deployments.

Under the covers, messages are stored in a traditional MySQL table and therefore enjoy the following properties: * **Scalable**: Because of Vitess's sharding abilities, messages can scale to very large QPS or sizes. * **Guaranteed delivery**: A message will be indefinitely retried until a successful ack is received. * **Non-blocking**: If the sending is backlogged, new messages continue to be accepted for eventual delivery. * **Adaptive**: Messages that fail delivery are backed off exponentially with jitter to prevent thundering herds. * **Analytics**: Acknowledged messages are retained for a period of time — dictated by the `time_acked` value for the row and the `vt_purge_after` (seconds) value provided for the table — and can be used for analytics. * **Transactional**: Messages can be created or acked as part of an existing transaction. The action will complete only if the commit succeeds. The properties of a message are chosen by the application. However, every message needs a uniquely identifiable key. If the messages are stored in a sharded table, the key must also be the primary vindex of the table. Although messages will generally be delivered in the order they're created, this is not an explicit guarantee of the system. The focus is more on keeping track of the work that needs to be done and ensuring that it was performed. Messages are good for: * Handing off work to another system. * Recording potentially time-consuming work that needs to be done asynchronously. * Accumulating work that could be done during off-peak hours. Messages are not a good fit for the following use cases: * Broadcasting each event to multiple subscribers. * Ordered delivery is required. * Real-time delivery properties are required. ## Creating a message table The current implementation requires a base fixed schema with properties defined using Vitess specific table `COMMENT` directives. The message table format is as follows: ```sql create table my_message( # required columns id bigint NOT NULL COMMENT 'often an event id, can also be auto-increment or a sequence', priority tinyint

What Is Vitess weight: 1 featured: true --- Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of open-source database instances. It currently supports MySQL and Percona Server for MySQL. It's architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many important SQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database. Vitess can help you with the following problems: 1. Scaling a SQL database by allowing you to shard it, while keeping application changes to a minimum. 2. Migrating from bare-metal or VMs to a private or public cloud. 3. Deploying and managing a large number of SQL database instances. Vitess includes compliant JDBC and Go database drivers using a native query protocol. Additionally, it implements the MySQL server protocol which is compatible with virtually any other language. Vitess served all YouTube database traffic for over five years. Many enterprises have now adopted Vitess for their production needs. ## Features * Performance - Connection pooling - Multiplex front-end application queries onto a pool of MySQL connections to optimize performance. - Query de-duping – Reuse results of an in-flight query for any identical requests received while the in-flight query was still executing. - Transaction manager – Limit number of concurrent transactions and manage timeouts to optimize overall throughput. * Protection - Query rewriting and sanitization – Add limits and avoid non-deterministic updates. - Query blocking – Customize rules to prevent potentially problematic queries from hitting your database. - Query killing – Terminate queries that take too long to return data. - Table ACLs – Specify access control lists (ACLs) for tables based on the connected user. * Monitoring - Performance analysis tools let you monitor, diagnose, and analyze your database performance. * Topology Management Tools - Cluster management tools (handles planned and unplanned failovers) - Web-based management GUI - Designed to work in multiple data centers / regions * Sharding - Virtually seamless dynamic re-sharding - Vertical and Horizontal sharding support - Multiple sharding schemes, with the ability to plug-in custom ones ## Comparisons to other storage options The following sections compare Vitess to two common alternatives, a vanilla MySQL implementation and a NoSQL implementation. ### Vitess vs. Vanilla MySQL Vitess improves a vanilla MySQL implementation in several ways: | Vanilla MySQL | Vitess | |:--|:--| | Every MySQL connection has a memory overhead that ranges between 256KB and almost 3MB, depending on which MySQL release you're using. As your user base grows, you need to add RAM to support additional connections, but the RAM does not contribute to faster queries. In addition, there is a significant CPU cost associated with obtaining the connections. | Vitess creates very lightweight connections. Vitess' connection pooling feature uses Go's concurrency support to map these lightweight connections to a small pool of MySQL connections. As such, Vitess can easily handle thousands of connections. | | Poorly written queries, such as those that don't set a LIMIT, can negatively impact

additional connections, but the RAM does not contribute to faster queries. In addition, there is a significant CPU cost associated with obtaining the connections. | Vitess creates very lightweight connections. Vitess' connection pooling feature uses Go's concurrency support to map these lightweight connections to a small pool of MySQL connections. As such, Vitess can easily handle thousands of connections. | | Poorly written queries, such as those that don't set a LIMIT, can negatively impact database performance for all users. | Vitess employs a SQL parser that uses a configurable set of rules to rewrite queries that might hurt database performance. | | Sharding is a process of partitioning your data to improve scalability and performance. MySQL lacks native sharding support, requiring you to write sharding code and embed sharding logic in your application. | Vitess supports a variety of sharding schemes. It can also migrate tables into different databases and scale the number of shards up or down. These functions are performed non-intrusively, completing most data transitions with just a few seconds of read-only downtime. | | A MySQL cluster using replication for availability has a primary database and a few replicas. If the primary fails, a replica should become the new primary. This requires you to manage the database lifecycle and communicate the current system state to your application. | Vitess helps to manage the lifecycle of your database servers. It supports and automatically handles various scenarios, including primary failure detection and recovery. It also has support for data backups and restores. | | A MySQL cluster can have custom database configurations for different workloads, like a primary database for writes, fast read-only replicas for web clients, slower read-only replicas for batch jobs, and so forth. If the database has horizontal sharding, the setup is repeated for each shard, and the app needs baked-in logic to know how to find the right database. | Vitess uses a topology backed by a consistent data store, like etcd or ZooKeeper. This means the cluster view is always up-to-date and consistent for different clients. Vitess also provides a proxy that routes queries efficiently to the most appropriate MySQL instance. | ### Vitess vs. NoSQL If you're considering a NoSQL solution primarily because of concerns about the scalability of MySQL, Vitess might be a more appropriate choice for your application. While NoSQL provides great support for unstructured data, Vitess still offers several benefits not available in NoSQL datastores: | NoSQL | Vitess | |:--|:--| | NoSQL databases do not define relationships between database tables, and only support a subset of the SQL language. | Vitess is not a simple key-value store. It supports complex query semantics such as where clauses, JOINS, aggregation functions, and more. | | NoSQL datastores do not usually support transactions. | Vitess supports transactions. | | NoSQL solutions have custom APIs, leading to custom architectures, applications, and tools. | Vitess adds very little variance to MySQL, a database that most people are already accustomed to working with. |
