QUESTION: What are the key differences between the semi_sync, semi_sync_with_rdonly_ack, and cross_cell durability policies in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Key Differences Between Semi-Sync Durability Policies in Vitess

The key differences between the semi-sync durability policies in Vitess are:

* **semi_sync (none)**: 
  + Does not set any semi-sync configuration.
  + Returns NeutralPromoteRule for REPLICA tablet types, MustNotPromoteRule for everything else.
* **cross_cell**:
  + Sets the number of required semi-sync acknowledgements to 1.
  + Only allows REPLICA type tablets from a different cell than the current primary to send semi-sync acknowledgements.
  + Returns NeutralPromoteRule for REPLICA tablet types, MustNotPromoteRule for everything else.
* **cross_cell_with_rdonly_ack**:
  + Sets the number of required semi-sync acknowledgements to 1.
  + Only allows REPLICA and RDONLY type tablets from a different cell than the current primary to send semi-sync acknowledgements.
  + Returns NeutralPromoteRule for REPLICA tablet types, MustNotPromoteRule for everything else.

In summary, the main differences between these policies are the types of tablets allowed to send semi-sync acknowledgements and the configuration of semi-sync settings. The `cross_cell_with_rdonly_ack` policy allows both REPLICA and RDONLY tablets to send acknowledgements, while the `cross_cell` policy only allows REPLICA tablets. The `semi_sync (none)` policy does not set any semi-sync configuration.

[EmergencyReparentShard](../../configuration-advanced/reparenting/#emergencyreparentshard-emergency-reparenting) and [PlannedReparentShard](../../configuration-advanced/reparenting/#plannedreparentshard-planned-reparenting) will use the durability rules while choosing the correct candidate for promotion. This configuration must be stored in the topo server in the keyspace record using the command [CreateKeyspace](../../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_createkeyspace/) or [SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy](../../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_setkeyspacedurabilitypolicy/). --- title: Exporting data from Vitess weight: 18 aliases: ['/docs/user-guides/exporting-data/'] --- Since [VTGate](../../../concepts/vtgate/) supports the MySQL protocol, in many cases it is possible to use existing client utilities when connecting to Vitess. This includes using logical dump tools such as `mysqldump`, in certain cases. This guide provides instructions on the required options when using these tools against a VTGate server for the purposes of exporting data from Vitess. It is recommended to follow the [Backup and Restore](../../operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/) guide for regular backups, since this method is performed directly on the tablet servers and is more efficient and safer for databases of any significant size. The dump methods that follow are typically not suitable for production backups, because Vitess does not implement all the locking constructs across a sharded database that are necessary to do a consistent logical backup while writing to the database. As a result, you will only be guaranteed to get a 100% consistent dump using these tools if you are sure that you are not writing to the database while running the dump. ### mysqldump The default invocation of `mysqldump` attempts to execute statements which are [not supported by Vitess](../../../reference/compatibility/mysql-compatibility/), such as attempting to lock tables and dump GTID coordinates. The following options are required when using the `mysqldump` binary from MySQL 5.7 to export data from the `commerce` keyspace: * `--lock-tables=off`: VTGate currently prohibits the syntax `LOCK TABLES` and `UNLOCK TABLES`. * `--set-gtid-purged=OFF`: `mysqldump` attemps to dump GTID coordinates of a server, but in the case of VTGate this does not make sense since it could be routing to multiple servers. * `--no-tablespaces`: This option disables dumping InnoDB tables by tablespace. This functionality is not yet supported by Vitess. * `....`: Additional mysqldump options like: `-u <user>`, `-p <password>`, `-h <database server hostname>`. For example to export the `commerce` keyspace using the `mysqldump` binary from MySQL 5.7: ```sh $ mysqldump --set-gtid-purged=OFF --no-tablespaces .... commerce > commerce.sql ``` {{< info >}} Vitess' support for LOCK and UNLOCK statements is currently syntax-only.

In addition, Vitess only supports the default `binlog_row_image` of `FULL`. {{< /warning >}} Vitess makes use of MySQL Replication for both high availability and to receive a feed of changes to database tables. This feed is then used in features such as [VReplication](../../vreplication/vreplication/), and to identify schema changes so that caches can be updated. ## Semi-Sync Vitess strongly recommends the use of Semi-synchronous replication for High Availability. The characteristics of semi-sync are replication governed by the [Durability Policy](../../../user-guides/configuration-basic/durability_policy) configured for the keyspace. Some characteristics are shared by all the policies - * Vitess configures the semi-sync timeout to essentially an unlimited number so that it will never fallback to asyncronous replication. This is important to prevent split brain (or alternate futures) in case of a network partition. If we can verify all replicas have stopped replicating, we know the old primary is not accepting writes, even if we are unable to contact the old primary itself. * All pre-configured durability policies do not allow tablets of type rdonly to send semi-sync ACKs. This is intentional because rdonly tablets are not eligible to be promoted to primary, so Vitess avoids the case where a rdonly tablet is the single best candidate for election at the time of primary failure. Having semi-sync enabled, gives you the property that, in case of primary failure, there is at least one other replica that has every transaction that was ever reported to clients as having completed. You can then wait for [VTOrc](../../../user-guides/configuration-basic/vtorc) to repair it, or ([manually](../../programs/vtctl/shards/#emergencyreparentshard) pick the replica that is farthest ahead in GTID position and promote that to be the new primary. Thus, you can survive sudden primary failure without losing any transactions that were reported to clients as completed. In MySQL 5.7+, this guarantee is strengthened slightly to preventing loss of any transactions that were ever **committed** on the original primary, eliminating so-called [phantom reads](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=62174). On the other hand these behaviors also give a requirement that each shard must have at least 2 tablets with type *replica* (with addition of the primary that can be demoted to type *replica* this gives a minimum of 3 tablets with initial type *replica*). This will allow for the primary to have a semi-sync acker when one of the replica tablets is down for any reason (for a version update, machine reboot, or anything else). These requirements will changed based on the durability policy. With regard to replication lag, note that this does **not** guarantee there is always at least one replica from which queries will always return up-to-date results. Semi-sync guarantees that at least one replica has the transaction in its relay log, but it has not necessarily been applied yet. The only way Vitess guarantees a fully

hurdle is crossed. There are fewer lock contentions to worry about, replication is a lot happier, production impact of outages is smaller, backups and restores run faster, and a lot more secondary advantages can be realized. For example, you can shuffle instances around to get better machine or rack diversity leading to even smaller production impact on outages, and improved resource usage. ## Durability through replication Traditional data storage software treated data as durable as soon as it was flushed to disk. However, this approach is impractical in today’s world of commodity hardware. Such an approach also does not address disaster scenarios. The new approach to durability is achieved by copying the data to multiple machines, and even geographical locations. This form of durability addresses the modern concerns of device failures and disasters. Many of the workflows in Vitess have been built with this approach in mind. For example, turning on semi-sync replication is highly recommended. This allows Vitess to failover to a new replica when a primary goes down, with no data loss. Vitess also recommends that you avoid recovering a crashed database. Instead, create a fresh one from a recent backup and let it catch up. Relying on replication also allows you to loosen some of the disk-based durability settings. For example, you can turn off `sync_binlog`, which greatly reduces the number of IOPS to the disk thereby increasing effective throughput. ## Consistency model Before sharding or moving tables to different keyspaces, the application needs to be verified (or changed) such that it can tolerate the following changes: * Cross-shard reads may not be consistent with each other. Conversely, the sharding decision should also attempt to minimize such occurrences because cross-shard reads are more expensive. * In "best-effort mode", cross-shard transactions can fail in the middle and result in partial commits. You could instead use "2PC mode" transactions that give you distributed atomic guarantees. However, choosing this option increases the write cost by approximately 50%. Single shard transactions continue to remain ACID, just like MySQL supports it. If there are read-only code paths that can tolerate slightly stale data, the queries should be sent to REPLICA tablets for OLTP, and RDONLY tablets for OLAP workloads. This allows you to scale your read traffic more easily, and gives you the ability to distribute them geographically. This trade-off allows for better throughput at the expense of stale or possibly inconsistent reads, since the reads may be lagging behind the primary, as data changes (and possibly with varying lag on different shards). To mitigate this, VTGate servers are capable of monitoring replica lag and can be configured to avoid serving data from instances that are lagging beyond X seconds. For a true snapshot, queries must be sent to the primary within a transaction. For read-after-write consistency, reading from the primary without a transaction is sufficient. To summarize, these are the various levels of consistency supported: * `REPLICA/RDONLY` read: Servers can be scaled geographically. Local reads are fast, but can be stale

--- title: v22.0 (Development) description: > Under construction, development release. Everything you need to know about scaling MySQL with Vitess. notoc: true cascade: version: v22.0 weight: 78 --- --- title: Cell description: Data center, availability zone or group of computing resources --- A *cell* is a group of servers and network infrastructure collocated in an area, and isolated from failures in other cells. It is typically either a full data center or a subset of a data center, sometimes called a *zone* or *availability zone*. Vitess gracefully handles cell-level failures, such as when a cell is cut off the network. Each cell in a Vitess implementation has a [local topology service](../topology-service), which is hosted in that cell. The topology service contains most of the information about the Vitess tablets in its cell. This enables a cell to be taken down and rebuilt as a unit. Vitess limits cross-cell traffic for both data and metadata. While it may be useful to also have the ability to route read traffic to individual cells, Vitess currently serves reads only from the local cell. Writes will go cross-cell when necessary, to wherever the primary for that shard resides. --- title: Execution Plans --- Vitess parses queries at both the VTGate and VTTablet layer in order to evaluate the best method to execute a query. This evaluation is known as query planning, and results in a _query execution plan_. The Execution Plan is dependent on both the query and the associated [VSchema](../vschema). One of the underlying goals of Vitess' planning strategy is to push down as much work as possible to the underlying MySQL instances. When this is not possible, Vitess will use a plan that collects input from multiple sources and merges the results to produce the correct query result. ### Evaluation Model An execution plan consists of operators, each of which implements a specific piece of work. The operators combine into a tree-like structure, which represents the overall execution plan. The plan represents each operator as a node in the tree. Each operator takes as input zero or more rows, and produces as output zero or more rows. This means that the output from one operator becomes the input for the next operator. Operators that join two branches in the tree combine input from two incoming streams and produce a single output. Evaluation of the execution plan begins at the leaf nodes of the tree. Leaf nodes pull in data from VTTablet, the Topology Service, and in some cases are also able to evaluate expression values locally. Each leaf node will not have input from other operators, and pipe in any nodes they produce into their parent nodes. The parents nodes will then pipe in nodes to their parent nodes, all the way up to a root node. The root node produces the final results of the query and delivers the results to the user. ### Routing Operators A routing operator in an execution plan instructs Vitess which destination to send a piece
