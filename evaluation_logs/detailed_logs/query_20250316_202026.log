QUESTION: What is an execution plan in Vitess, and how does it optimize query execution?

ANSWER: ### Execution Plan in Vitess
An execution plan in Vitess is the result of query planning, which evaluates the best method to execute a query. It is dependent on both the query and the associated [VSchema](../vschema).

### Optimization of Query Execution
The execution plan optimizes query execution in the following ways:

* **Pushing work to MySQL instances**: Vitess aims to push down as much work as possible to the underlying MySQL instances.
* **Collecting and merging results**: When necessary, Vitess collects input from multiple sources and merges the results to produce the correct query result.
* **Tree-like structure**: The execution plan consists of operators that combine into a tree-like structure, representing the overall execution plan.
* **Operator nodes**: Each operator node takes input from zero or more rows and produces output as zero or more rows, allowing for efficient processing of queries.
* **Evaluation from leaf nodes**: Evaluation of the execution plan begins at the leaf nodes, which pull in data from VTTablet, the Topology Service, and evaluate expression values locally.

By using this approach, Vitess optimizes query execution and improves performance.

--- title: v22.0 (Development) description: > Under construction, development release. Everything you need to know about scaling MySQL with Vitess. notoc: true cascade: version: v22.0 weight: 78 --- --- title: Cell description: Data center, availability zone or group of computing resources --- A *cell* is a group of servers and network infrastructure collocated in an area, and isolated from failures in other cells. It is typically either a full data center or a subset of a data center, sometimes called a *zone* or *availability zone*. Vitess gracefully handles cell-level failures, such as when a cell is cut off the network. Each cell in a Vitess implementation has a [local topology service](../topology-service), which is hosted in that cell. The topology service contains most of the information about the Vitess tablets in its cell. This enables a cell to be taken down and rebuilt as a unit. Vitess limits cross-cell traffic for both data and metadata. While it may be useful to also have the ability to route read traffic to individual cells, Vitess currently serves reads only from the local cell. Writes will go cross-cell when necessary, to wherever the primary for that shard resides. --- title: Execution Plans --- Vitess parses queries at both the VTGate and VTTablet layer in order to evaluate the best method to execute a query. This evaluation is known as query planning, and results in a _query execution plan_. The Execution Plan is dependent on both the query and the associated [VSchema](../vschema). One of the underlying goals of Vitess' planning strategy is to push down as much work as possible to the underlying MySQL instances. When this is not possible, Vitess will use a plan that collects input from multiple sources and merges the results to produce the correct query result. ### Evaluation Model An execution plan consists of operators, each of which implements a specific piece of work. The operators combine into a tree-like structure, which represents the overall execution plan. The plan represents each operator as a node in the tree. Each operator takes as input zero or more rows, and produces as output zero or more rows. This means that the output from one operator becomes the input for the next operator. Operators that join two branches in the tree combine input from two incoming streams and produce a single output. Evaluation of the execution plan begins at the leaf nodes of the tree. Leaf nodes pull in data from VTTablet, the Topology Service, and in some cases are also able to evaluate expression values locally. Each leaf node will not have input from other operators, and pipe in any nodes they produce into their parent nodes. The parents nodes will then pipe in nodes to their parent nodes, all the way up to a root node. The root node produces the final results of the query and delivers the results to the user. ### Routing Operators A routing operator in an execution plan instructs Vitess which destination to send a piece

includes query execution tools for performance analysis and debugging, featuring the embedded [VTExplain](../../reference/programs/vtexplain) tool to help users optimize SQL queries and understand execution plans. VTAdmin helps users and operators by facilitating efficient operations and effective management of distributed Vitess environments. For more information about VTAdmin, please refer to the following links: * [VTAdmin Intro Blog Post](/blog/2022-12-05-vtadmin-intro/) * [VTAdmin Documentation](../../../21.0/reference/vtadmin/) --- title: vtctl --- **vtctl** is the Vitess control system used to administer a Vitess cluster. It consists of a command-line client, [`vtctldclient`](../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/), that is used as both a standalone tool (`vtctldclient --server=internal`) and more commonly in client-server mode with [`vtctldclient`](../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/) interacting with a [`vtctld`](../../reference/programs/vtctld/) server. Using client-server mode is recommended, as it provides an additional layer of security when using the client remotely. Using this you can identify primary and replica databases, create tables, initiate failovers, perform resharding operations, and so forth. As operations are performed the [Topology Service](../topology-service/) is updated as needed. Other Vitess processes observe those changes and react accordingly. For example, if you use `vtctldclient` to fail over to a new primary database using [`PlannedReparentShard`](../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_plannedreparentshard/), [`vtgate`](../../reference/programs/vtgate/) sees the changes in the [Topology Service](../topology-service/) and directs future write operations to the new primary. Please see the [reference documentation](../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/) for additional details. --- title: vtctld --- **vtctld** is an HTTP server that lets you browse the information stored in the Topology Service. It is useful for troubleshooting or for getting a high-level overview of the servers and their current states. `vtctld` also acts as the server for `vtctldclient` connections. --- title: VTGate --- VTGate is a lightweight proxy server that routes traffic to the correct [VTTablet](../tablet) servers and returns consolidated results back to the client. It speaks both the MySQL Protocol and the Vitess gRPC protocol. Thus, your applications can connect to VTGate as if it is a MySQL Server. When routing queries to the appropriate VTTablet servers, VTGate considers the sharding scheme, required latency and the availability of tables and their underlying MySQL instances. **Related Vitess Documentation** * [Execution Plans](../execution-plans) --- title: Concepts description: Learn core Vitess concepts and terminology aliases: ['/docs/overview/concepts/'] weight: 3 --- --- title: Local Install via source for Mac description: Instructions for using Vitess on your macOS machine for testing purposes weight: 4 --- This guide covers installing Vitess locally for testing purposes, from pre-compiled binaries.

What Is Vitess weight: 1 featured: true --- Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of open-source database instances. It currently supports MySQL and Percona Server for MySQL. It's architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many important SQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database. Vitess can help you with the following problems: 1. Scaling a SQL database by allowing you to shard it, while keeping application changes to a minimum. 2. Migrating from bare-metal or VMs to a private or public cloud. 3. Deploying and managing a large number of SQL database instances. Vitess includes compliant JDBC and Go database drivers using a native query protocol. Additionally, it implements the MySQL server protocol which is compatible with virtually any other language. Vitess served all YouTube database traffic for over five years. Many enterprises have now adopted Vitess for their production needs. ## Features * Performance - Connection pooling - Multiplex front-end application queries onto a pool of MySQL connections to optimize performance. - Query de-duping – Reuse results of an in-flight query for any identical requests received while the in-flight query was still executing. - Transaction manager – Limit number of concurrent transactions and manage timeouts to optimize overall throughput. * Protection - Query rewriting and sanitization – Add limits and avoid non-deterministic updates. - Query blocking – Customize rules to prevent potentially problematic queries from hitting your database. - Query killing – Terminate queries that take too long to return data. - Table ACLs – Specify access control lists (ACLs) for tables based on the connected user. * Monitoring - Performance analysis tools let you monitor, diagnose, and analyze your database performance. * Topology Management Tools - Cluster management tools (handles planned and unplanned failovers) - Web-based management GUI - Designed to work in multiple data centers / regions * Sharding - Virtually seamless dynamic re-sharding - Vertical and Horizontal sharding support - Multiple sharding schemes, with the ability to plug-in custom ones ## Comparisons to other storage options The following sections compare Vitess to two common alternatives, a vanilla MySQL implementation and a NoSQL implementation. ### Vitess vs. Vanilla MySQL Vitess improves a vanilla MySQL implementation in several ways: | Vanilla MySQL | Vitess | |:--|:--| | Every MySQL connection has a memory overhead that ranges between 256KB and almost 3MB, depending on which MySQL release you're using. As your user base grows, you need to add RAM to support additional connections, but the RAM does not contribute to faster queries. In addition, there is a significant CPU cost associated with obtaining the connections. | Vitess creates very lightweight connections. Vitess' connection pooling feature uses Go's concurrency support to map these lightweight connections to a small pool of MySQL connections. As such, Vitess can easily handle thousands of connections. | | Poorly written queries, such as those that don't set a LIMIT, can negatively impact

to use KEYS Use vexplain keys when you need to: * Identify potential sharding key candidates * Optimize query performance by understanding which columns are frequently used in filters and joins * Analyze query patterns across your application to inform database design decisions * Quickly understand the structure of complex queries By analyzing the KEYS output across multiple queries, you can make more informed decisions about sharding strategies, potentially improving query performance and data distribution in your Vitess deployment. # Safety for DML The normal behaviour for `VEXPLAIN` is to not actually run the query for DMLs — it usually only plans the query and presents the produced plan for the `PLAN` type. Since `vexplain ALL|QUERIES` really runs your queries, you need to add a query directive to show that you are aware that your DML will actually run. ### Example: ```mysql mysql> vexplain queries insert into customer(email) values('abc@xyz.com'); ERROR 1105 (HY000): VT09008: vexplain queries/all will actually run queries ``` This is the error you will get is you do not add the comment directive to your `VEXPLAIN` statement. ### Example: ```mysql mysql> vexplain /*vt+ EXECUTE_DML_QUERIES */ queries insert into customer(email) values('abc@xyz.com'); +------+----------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | # | keyspace | shard | query | +------+----------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0 | customer | 80- | insert into customer(email, customer_id) values ('abc@xyz.com', 1001) | +------+----------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) ``` Here we can see how vtgate will insert rows to the main table, but also to the two lookup vindexes declared for this table. Note - MySQL client by default strips out the comments from the queries before it sends to the server. So you'll need to run the client with `-c` flag to allow passing in comments. --- title: Analyzing SQL statements in bulk using VTEXPLAIN weight: 2 aliases: ['/docs/user-guides/vtexplain-in-bulk/'] --- # Introduction This document covers the way the [VTexplain tool](../../../reference/programs/vtexplain) can be used to evaluate if Vitess is compatible with a list of SQL statements. Enabling the evaluation of if queries from an existing application that accesses a MySQL database are generally Vitess-compatible. If there are any issues identified they can be used to target any necessary application changes needed for a successful migration from MySQL to Vitess. ## Prerequisites You can find a prebuilt binary version of the VTexplain tool in [the most recent release of Vitess](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/). You can also build the `vtexplain` binary in your environment. To build this binary, refer to the [build guide](/docs/contributing) for your OS. ## Overview To analyze multiple SQL queries and determine how, or if, Vitess executes each statement, follow these steps: 1. Gather the queries from your current MySQL database environment 1. Filter out specific queries 1. Populate fake values for your queries 1. Run the VTexplain tool via a script 1. Add your SQL schema 1. Add your VSchema to the output file 1. Run the VTexplain tool and capture the output 1. Check your output for errors ## 1.
