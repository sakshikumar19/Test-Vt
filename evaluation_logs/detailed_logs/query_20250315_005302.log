QUESTION: How does Vitess handle replication during resharding?

ANSWER: ### Replication Handling in Vitess During Resharding
I don't have enough information to answer this question. The provided context discusses initializing the first primary in a shard, emergency reparenting, and other topics but does not specifically address how Vitess handles replication during the resharding process. 

To accurately answer this question, more information about Vitess's resharding process and how it manages replication during this operation would be necessary. Specifically, details on whether Vitess pauses replication, how it ensures data consistency across shards during resharding, or any specific replication settings recommended for resharding would be helpful.

the following actions when used to initialize the first primary in the shard: 1. Promote the new primary that is specified. 1. Ensures replication is functioning properly via the following steps: - On the primary-elect tablet, insert a row into an internal table and then update the global shard object's PrimaryAlias record. - In parallel on each replica, set the new primary as the replication source and wait for the inserted row to replicate to the replica tablets. The new primary (if unspecified) is chosen using the configured [Durability Policy](../../configuration-basic/durability_policy). In order to make planned maintenance operations zero-downtime, Vitess provides the capability of [buffering]((../../../reference/features/vtgate-buffering)) queries for the duration of the reparent operation. While this is optional, it is highly recommended. With the proper settings, buffering can handle all non-transactional queries with zero errors. Transactions are handled differently, we cannot buffer them because transaction state is held in the backing MySQL and not in Vitess. When we start the process of shutting down the current primary's query service, we wait for a specified grace period to allow in-flight transactions to complete. During this time, we do not start new transactions on the current primary. Instead, we buffer the `begin` statements that would typically start a new transaction. Once the grace period is complete, any transactions that are still in-flight are killed, and an error is returned to the client. Clients are expected to treat this error as fatal, abandon any open transactions, and start new ones for subsequent operations. ### EmergencyReparentShard: Emergency reparenting The `EmergencyReparentShard` command is used to force a reparent to a new primary when the current primary is unavailable. The command assumes that data cannot be retrieved from the current primary because it is dead or not working properly. As such, this command does not rely on the

within any individual transaction. Enabling two-phase commit in Vitess to support cross-shard writes is possible, but will come at a significant performance cost. Whether that tradeoff is worth it differs from application to application and, generally speaking, adjusting the schema/workload is considered the better approach. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## Why do auto-increment columns not work in sharded Vitess? Auto-increment columns do not work very well for sharded tables. Vitess sequences solve this problem. Sequence tables must be specified in the VSchema and then tied to table columns. At the time of insert, if no value is specified for such a column, VTGate will generate a number for it using the sequence table. Vitess also supports sequence generators that can be used to generate new ids that work like MySQL auto increment columns. The VSchema allows you to associate table columns to sequence tables. ## What is resharding? How does it work? Vitess supports resharding, in which the number of shards is changed on a live cluster. This can be either splitting one or more shards into smaller pieces, or merging neighboring shards into bigger pieces. During resharding, the data in the source shards is copied into the destination shards, allowed to catch up on replication, and then compared against the original to ensure data integrity. Then the live serving infrastructure is shifted to the destination shards, and the source shards are deleted. ## How are shards named? Shard names have the following characteristics: - They represent a range, where the left number is included, but the right is not. - Their notation is hexadecimal. - They are left justified. - A - prefix means: anything less than the RHS value. - A - postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. - A plain

a binary value equal to or higher than 0x80 are assigned to the other shard. Several sample key ranges are shown below: ``` sh Start=[], End=[]: Full Key Range Start=[], End=[0x80]: Lower half of the Key Range. Start=[0x80], End=[]: Upper half of the Key Range. Start=[0x40], End=[0x80]: Second quarter of the Key Range. Start=[0xFF00], End=[0xFF80]: Second to last 1/512th of the Key Range. ``` Two key ranges are consecutive if the end value of one range equals the start value of the other range. ### Shard Names A shard's name identifies the start and end of the shard's key range, printed in hexadecimal and separated by a hyphen. For instance, if a shard's key range is the array of bytes beginning with [ 0x80 ] and ending, noninclusively, with [ 0xc0], then the shard's name is `80-c0`. Using this naming convention, the following four shards would be a valid full partition: * -40 * 40-80 * 80-c0 * c0- Shards do not need to handle the same size portion of the key space. For example, the following five shards would also be a valid full partition, possibly with a highly uneven distribution of keys. * -80 * 80-c0 * c0-dc00 * dc00-dc80 * dc80- ## Resharding Resharding describes the process of updating the sharding scheme for a keyspace and dynamically reorganizing data to match the new scheme. During resharding, Vitess copies, verifies, and keeps data up-to-date on new shards while the existing shards continue to serve live read and write traffic. When you're ready to switch over, the migration occurs with only a few seconds of read-only downtime. During that time, existing data can be read, but new data cannot be written. The table below lists the sharding (or resharding) processes that you would typically perform for different types of
