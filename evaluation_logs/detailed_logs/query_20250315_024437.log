QUESTION: How do I check the version of my Vitess build?

ANSWER: ### Checking the Version of Your Vitess Build

To check the version of your Vitess build, you can use the following command:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git
$ cd vitess
$ make build
$ cd bin
$ ./vtctl version
```
However, since the provided context does not explicitly mention a `version` command for Vitess, you can check the version of the tools you have installed, such as `go`, `mysql`, `mysqld`, `etcd`, `node`, and `npm`, using the following commands:
```sh
$ go version
$ mysql --version
$ mysqld --version
$ etcd --version
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```
If you need to verify the Vitess version, you may want to check the `git` repository or the build artifacts for version information. 

I don't have enough information to provide a direct command to check the Vitess version. More information about the Vitess build process or the `vtctl` command might help.

shutdown of MySQL: ```sh $ brew services stop mysql ``` ### Install Node 18.16.0+ (required to run VTAdmin) ```bash brew install nvm nvm install --lts 18.16.0 nvm use 18.16.0 ``` See the [vtadmin README](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/web/vtadmin/README.md) for more details. ## PATH Settings With the tools you’ve just installed via brew, you will next update your PATH variable so your shell knows where to find the binaries: ```sh echo "export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql/bin:${HOME}/go/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin" >> ~/.zshrc source ~/.zshrc ``` If you’re using bash for your shell you’ll have to update the paths in `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` instead. Mac does not read `.bashrc` by default: ```sh echo "export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql/bin:${HOME}/go/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile source ~/.bash_profile ``` ## System Check Before going further, you should check to confirm your shell has access to `go`, `mysql`, and `mysqld`. If versions are not returned when you run the following commands you should check that the programs are installed and the path is correct for your shell: ```sh $ mysqld --version $ mysql --version $ go version $ etcd --version $ node --version $ npm --version ``` ## Install Vitess With everything now in place you can clone and build Vitess. ```sh $ git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git $ cd vitess $ make build ``` It will take some time for Vitess to build. Once it completes you should see a bin folder which will hold the Vitess binaries. You will need to add this folder to your `PATH` variable as well: ```sh $ cd bin $ echo "$(printf 'export PATH="${PATH}:'; echo "$(pwd)\"")" >> ~/.zshrc $ source ~/.zshrc ``` If you are using bash this will need to be your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file instead: ```sh $ cd bin $ echo "$(printf 'export PATH="${PATH}:'; echo "$(pwd)\"")" >> ~/.bash_profile $ source ~/.bash_profile ``` You are now ready to start your first cluster!

routed to a read-only replica (the old primary). Use the [`TabletExternallyReparented`](../../reference/programs/vtctl/shards/#tabletexternallyreparented) command to tell Vitess the new primary tablet for a shard. Older versions of Vitess supported tools like [Orchestrator](https://github.com/github/orchestrator), which can be configured to call this automatically when a failover occurs. See our sample [orchestrator.conf.json](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/1129d69282bb738c94b8af661b984b6377a759f7/docker/orchestrator/orchestrator.conf.json#L131) for an example of this. --- title: Troubleshoot aliases: ['/docs/launching/troubleshooting/'] description: Debug common issues with Vitess weight: 2600 --- If there is a problem in the system, one or many alerts would typically fire. If a problem was found through means other than an alert, then the alert system needs to be iterated upon. When an alert fires, you have the following sources of information to perform your investigation: * Alert values * Graphs * Diagnostic URLs * Log files ### Find version of Vitess build ``` select @@version; ```

``` ## Install Node ```sh curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash ``` Ensure the following is in your bashrc/zshrc or similar. `nvm` automatically attempts to add them: ```bash export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ``` Finally, install [node](https://nodejs.org/): ```sh nvm install 18 nvm use 18 ``` See the [vtadmin README](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/web/vtadmin/README.md) for more details. ## Disable AppArmor or SELinux AppArmor/SELinux will not allow Vitess to launch MySQL in any data directory by default. You will need to disable it: __AppArmor__: ```sh # Debian and Ubuntu sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld /etc/apparmor.d/disable/ sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld # The following command should return an empty result: sudo aa-status | grep mysqld ``` __SELinux__: ```sh # CentOS sudo setenforce 0 ``` ## Install Vitess Download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases) for Vitess on Linux: **Notes:** * Ubuntu is the only fully supported OS, for another OS please [build Vitess by yourself](/docs/contributing) or use the Docker images. ```sh version="{{< latest_release >}}" url="$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/vitessio/vitess/releases | jq --arg version "${version}" -r '[.[] | select(.tag_name | contains($version))] | sort_by(.created_at) | reverse | .[0:1] | .[] | .assets[] | select(.content_type | contains("application/gzip")) | .browser_download_url')" file="${url##*/}" curl -LO "${url}" tar -xzf ${file} cd ${file/.tar.gz/} sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/vitess sudo cp -r * /usr/local/vitess/ ``` Make sure to add `/usr/local/vitess/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable. You can do this by adding the following to your `$HOME/.bashrc` file: ```sh export PATH=/usr/local/vitess/bin:${PATH} ``` You are now ready to start your first cluster! Open a new terminal window to ensure your `.bashrc` file changes take effect. ## Start a Single Keyspace Cluster Start by copying the local examples included with Vitess to your preferred location. For our first example we will deploy a [single unsharded keyspace](../../concepts/keyspace). The file `101_initial_cluster.sh` is for example
