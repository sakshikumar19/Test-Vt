QUESTION: How do I monitor long-running queries in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Monitoring Long-Running Queries in Vitess
To monitor long-running queries in Vitess, you can use the Vitess web UI. 

Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Access the VTGate Web UI**: Open a web browser and navigate to the VTGate web UI. The URL is typically `http://localhost:15001/debug`.
2. **Check the `/debug/vars` Page**: Click on the `/debug/vars` link to view the variables page. This page contains various metrics, including query metrics.
3. **Look for the `VTGateApi` Histogram**: On the `/debug/vars` page, look for the `VTGateApi` histogram variable. This variable tracks query metrics, including the duration of queries.
4. **Check the `/debug/query_plans` Page**: You can also check the `/debug/query_plans` page to view the query plans for long-running queries.

Additionally, you can use the `HealthcheckConnections` variable on the `/debug/vars` page to monitor the number of tablet connections for query/healthcheck per keyspace, shard, and tablet type.

By monitoring these metrics, you can identify long-running queries and take corrective action to optimize their performance. 

Note: For more detailed information on monitoring Vitess, you can refer to the [Vitess documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/vttablet-mysql/).

background processing jobs, such as taking backups, dumping data to other systems, heavy analytical queries, and resharding. There are some other tablet types like `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`. For information on how to use tablets please review this [user guide](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/vttablet-mysql/). ## What is a shard? A shard is a physical division within a keyspace; i.e. how data is split across multiple MySQL instances. A shard typically consists of one MySQL primary and one or more MySQL replicas. Each MySQL instance within a shard has the same data, if the effect of MySQL replication lag is ignored. The replicas can serve read-only traffic, execute long-running queries from data analysis tools, or perform administrative tasks. An unsharded keyspace always has only a single shard. --- title: Metrics weight: 7 --- ## How can I monitor or get metrics from Vitess? All Vitess components have a web UI that you can access to see the state of each component. The first place to look is the `/debug/status` page. * This is the main landing page for a VTGate, which displays the status of a particular server. A list of tablets this VTGate process is connected to is also displayed, as this is the list of tablets that can potentially serve queries. A second place to look is the `/debug/vars` page. For example, for VTGate, this page contains the following items: * VTGateApi - This is the main histogram variable to track for VTGates. It gives you a breakdown of all queries by command, keyspace, and type. * HealthcheckConnections - It shows the number of tablet connections for query/healthcheck per keyspace, shard, and tablet type. There are two other pages you can use to get monitoring information from Vitess in the VTGate web UI: * `/debug/query_plans` - This URL gives you all the query plans

to access the `product` table. You can now insert rows into the table: ```text $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 12348 [snip] mysql> insert into product(pname) values ('monitor'), ('keyboard'); Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec) mysql> select * from product; +------------+----------+ | product_id | pname | +------------+----------+ | 1 | monitor | | 2 | keyboard | +------------+----------+ 2 rows in set (0.00 sec) ``` The insert does not specify values for `product_id`, because we are relying on MySQL’s `auto_increment` feature to populate it. You will notice that we did not connect to the `product` database or issue a `use` statement to select it. This is the ‘unspecified’ mode supported by Vitess. As long as a table name can be uniquely identified from the vschemas, Vitess will automatically direct the query to the correct keyspace. You can also connect or specify keyspaces as if they were MySQL databases. The following constructs are valid: ```text mysql> select * from product.product; +------------+----------+ | product_id | pname | +------------+----------+ | 1 | monitor | | 2 | keyboard | +------------+----------+ 2 rows in set (0.00 sec) mysql> use product; Reading table information for completion of table and column names You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A Database changed mysql> select * from product; +------------+----------+ | product_id | pname | +------------+----------+ | 1 | monitor | | 2 | keyboard | +------------+----------+ 2 rows in set (0.01 sec) ``` --- title: Vindex Hints in Vitess weight: 20 --- Vindex hints provide a way for users to influence the shard routing of queries in Vitess by specifying which vindexes should be considered or ignored by the query planner. This feature enhances the control over query execution, allowing for potentially more efficient data access patterns in sharded databases. ## Overview

purging. --- title: Monitoring weight: 8 --- # Current state of monitoring There are currently three main ways that a Vitess cluster can be monitored. Depending on your needs, you can use any of the following methods: ## 1. Vitess status pages The status HTML pages of various Vitess components can be accessed by pointing your browser to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/status`. The status pages will often display some basic, but useful, information for monitoring. For example, the status page of a vttablet will show the QPS graph for the past few minutes. Viewing a status page can be useful since it works out of the box, but it only provides very basic monitoring capabilities. ## 2. Pull-based metrics system Vitess uses Go’s [expvar package](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/) to expose various metrics, with the expectation that a user can configure a pull-based metrics system to ingest those metrics. Metrics are published to `http://<host>:<port>/debug/vars` as JSON key-value pairs, which should be easy for any metrics system to parse. Scraping Vitess variables is a good way to integrate Vitess into an existing monitoring system, and is useful for building up detailed monitoring dashboards. It is also the officially supported way for monitoring Vitess. ## 3. Push-based metrics system Vitess also includes support for push-based metrics systems via plug-ins. Each Vitess component would need to be run with the `--emit_stats` flag. By default, the stats_emit_period is 60s, so each component will push stats to the selected backend every minute. This is configurable via the `--stats_emit_period` flag. Vitess has preliminary plug-ins to support OpenTSDB as a push-based metrics backend. It should be fairly straightforward to write your own plug-in, if you want to support a different backend. The plug-in package simply needs to implement the `PushBackend` interface of the `stats` package. For an example, you can see the [OpenTSDB plugin](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/stats/opentsdb/opentsdb.go).
