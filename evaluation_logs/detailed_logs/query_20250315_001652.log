QUESTION: How do I perform a resharding operation in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Performing a Resharding Operation in Vitess
To perform a resharding operation in Vitess, you need to update the sharding scheme for a keyspace and dynamically reorganize data to match the new scheme. Here are the general steps to follow:

#### Steps to Perform Resharding:

1. **Plan the New Sharding Scheme**: Determine the new sharding scheme, including the number of shards and the key ranges for each shard.
2. **Create the New Shards**: Create the new shards using the `CreateShard` command.
3. **Copy Data to New Shards**: Use the `CopyShard` command to copy data from the old shards to the new shards.
4. **Verify Data Consistency**: Verify that the data on the new shards is consistent with the data on the old shards.
5. **Switch to the New Shards**: Use the `MigrateServedFrom` command to switch the keyspace to the new shards.
6. **Remove the Old Shards**: Once the migration is complete, remove the old shards using the `DeleteShard` command.

#### Example:
Suppose you want to reshard a keyspace `my_keyspace` from 2 shards to 4 shards. You can use the following commands:
```bash
# Create the new shards
CreateShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=-40
CreateShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=40-80
CreateShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=80-c0
CreateShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=c0-

# Copy data to the new shards
CopyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -source_shard=old_shard1 -destination_shard=-40
CopyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -source_shard=old_shard1 -destination_shard=40-80
CopyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -source_shard=old_shard2 -destination_shard=80-c0
CopyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -source_shard=old_shard2 -destination_shard=c0-

# Verify data consistency
VerifyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=-40
VerifyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=40-80
VerifyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=80-c0
VerifyShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=c0-

# Switch to the new shards
MigrateServedFrom -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=-40
MigrateServedFrom -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=40-80
MigrateServedFrom -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=80-c0
MigrateServedFrom -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=c0-

# Remove the old shards
DeleteShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=old_shard1
DeleteShard -keyspace=my_keyspace -shard=old_shard2
```
Note that the exact commands and steps may vary depending on your specific use case and Vitess configuration. It's recommended to consult the Vitess documentation and seek guidance from a Vitess expert before performing a resharding operation.

a binary value equal to or higher than 0x80 are assigned to the other shard. Several sample key ranges are shown below: ``` sh Start=[], End=[]: Full Key Range Start=[], End=[0x80]: Lower half of the Key Range. Start=[0x80], End=[]: Upper half of the Key Range. Start=[0x40], End=[0x80]: Second quarter of the Key Range. Start=[0xFF00], End=[0xFF80]: Second to last 1/512th of the Key Range. ``` Two key ranges are consecutive if the end value of one range equals the start value of the other range. ### Shard Names A shard's name identifies the start and end of the shard's key range, printed in hexadecimal and separated by a hyphen. For instance, if a shard's key range is the array of bytes beginning with [ 0x80 ] and ending, noninclusively, with [ 0xc0], then the shard's name is `80-c0`. Using this naming convention, the following four shards would be a valid full partition: * -40 * 40-80 * 80-c0 * c0- Shards do not need to handle the same size portion of the key space. For example, the following five shards would also be a valid full partition, possibly with a highly uneven distribution of keys. * -80 * 80-c0 * c0-dc00 * dc00-dc80 * dc80- ## Resharding Resharding describes the process of updating the sharding scheme for a keyspace and dynamically reorganizing data to match the new scheme. During resharding, Vitess copies, verifies, and keeps data up-to-date on new shards while the existing shards continue to serve live read and write traffic. When you're ready to switch over, the migration occurs with only a few seconds of read-only downtime. During that time, existing data can be read, but new data cannot be written. The table below lists the sharding (or resharding) processes that you would typically perform for different types of

`discovery_low_replication_lag` -- a good rule of thumb is half of that setting or lower. --- title: Region Based Sharding weight: 25 aliases: ['/docs/user-guides/region-sharding/'] --- {{< info >}} This guide follows on from the Get Started guides. Please make sure that you have a [local](../../../get-started/local) installation ready. You should also have already gone through the [MoveTables](../../migration/move-tables) and [Resharding](../../configuration-advanced/resharding) tutorials. The commands in this guide also assume you have setup the shell aliases from this example contained in `env.sh`. {{< /info >}} ## Introduction Having gone through the [Resharding tutorial](../resharding/), you should be familiar with [VSchema](../../../reference/features/vschema) and [Vindexes](../../../reference/features/vindexes). In this tutorial, we will perform resharding on an existing keyspace using a location-based vindex. We will create 4 shards: `-40`, `40-80`, `80-c0`, `c0-`. The location will be denoted by a `country` column in the customer table. ## Create and Start the Cluster Start by copying the [`region_sharding` examples](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/main/examples/region_sharding) included with Vitess to your preferred location and running the `101_initial_cluster.sh` script: ```bash cp -r <vitess source path>/examples ~/my-vitess-example/examples cp -r <vitess source path>/web ~/my-vitess-example cd ~/my-vitess-example/examples/region_sharding ./101_initial_cluster.sh ``` ## Initial Schema This 101 script created the `customer` table in the unsharded `main` keyspace. This is the table that we will be sharding by country. We can connect to our new cluster — using the `mysql` alias setup by `env.sh` within the script — to confirm our current schema: ```mysql $ mysql --binary-as-hex=false ... mysql> show databases; +--------------------+ | Database | +--------------------+ | main | | information_schema | | mysql | | sys | | performance_schema | +--------------------+ 5 rows in set (0.00 sec) mysql> use customer; Database changed mysql> show tables; +----------------+ | Tables_in_main | +----------------+ | customer | +----------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) mysql> show create table customer\G *************************** 1. row *************************** Table: customer Create Table: CREATE TABLE `customer` ( `id`
