QUESTION: What is the difference between shard '80-' and '80-FF' in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Difference between Shard '80-' and '80-FF' in Vitess
The main difference between shard '80-' and '80-FF' in Vitess lies in their range definitions:

* `80-` means anything greater than or equal to `0x80`. This implies that any value with its highest bit set (i.e., >= `0x8000000000000000`) will fall into this shard.
* `80-FF` means anything within the range `8000-FF00`. This range does not include values greater than or equal to `0x8000` or less than `0x8000`, and it certainly does not include values like `FFFF` which is outside the defined range.

In essence, `80-` is an open-ended range that includes all values from `0x80` upwards without a specified upper bound, while `80-FF` defines a specific, bounded range. This distinction is crucial for understanding how data is distributed across shards in Vitess.

A plain `-` denotes the full keyrange. Thus: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` == `0000000000000000-8000000000000000` `80-` is not the same as `80-FF`. This is why: `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range. `80-` means: ‘anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A `xxhash` type vindex produces an unsigned 64 bit integer as output. This means that all integers **less** than `0x8000000000000000` will fall in shard `-80`. Any number with the highest bit set will be >= `0x8000000000000000`, and will therefore belong to shard `80-`. This left-justified approach allows you to have keyspace ids of arbitrary length. However, the most significant bits are the ones on the left. For example an `md5` hash produces 16 bytes. That can also be used as a keyspace id. A `varbinary` of arbitrary length can also be mapped as is to a keyspace id. This is what the `binary` vindex does. ## Resharding Vitess supports [resharding](../../user-guides/configuration-advanced/resharding), in which the number of shards is changed on a live cluster. This can be either splitting one or more shards into smaller pieces, or merging neighboring shards into bigger pieces. During resharding, the data in the source shards is copied into the destination shards, allowed to catch up on replication, and then compared against the original to ensure data integrity. Then the live serving infrastructure is shifted to the destination shards, and the source shards are deleted. **Related Vitess Documentation** * [Resharding User Guide](../../user-guides/configuration-advanced/resharding) --- title: Tablet --- A *tablet* is a combination of a `mysqld` process and a corresponding `vttablet` process, usually running on the same machine. Each tablet is assigned a *tablet type*, which specifies what role it currently performs. Queries are routed to a tablet via a [VTGate](../vtgate) server. ## Tablet Types See the user guide [VTTablet Modes](../../user-guides/configuration-basic/vttablet-mysql/)

range, where the left number is included, but the right is not. - Their notation is hexadecimal. - They are left justified. - A - prefix means: anything less than the RHS value. - A - postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. - A plain - denotes the full keyrange. An example of a shard name is `-80` and following the rules above this means: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` Similarly `80-` is not the same as `80-FF` because `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range as `80-` means: ‘anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A hash vindex produces an 8-byte number. This means that all numbers less than `0x8000000000000000` will fall in shard `-80`. Any number with the highest bit set will be >= `0x8000000000000000`, and will therefore belong to shard `80-`. ## What does “/0” or “/-”mean? `0` or `-` indicates that the keyspace in question is unsharded. This means that a single shard covers the entire keyrange. Note that while both `0` and `-` are supported for legacy reasons, you can’t merge into shard `0` only `-`. For this and other reasons, it is recommended to use `-` instead of `0`. On the other hand a sharded cluster will have multiple keyranges, for example `-80` and `80-` if you have two shards. Note, that you can still manually target a single shard from your sharded cluster. You can read more about that [here](https://vitess.io/docs/faq/operating-vitess/queries/#can-i-address-a-specific-shard-if-i-want-to). --- title: VReplication weight: 2 --- ## How can Movetables be used with duplicate table names?

During a failover, the replication graph enables Vitess to point all existing replicas to a newly designated primary database so that replication can continue. --- title: Shard --- A *shard* is a subset of a keyspace. A keyspace will always contain one or more shards. A shard typically contains one MySQL primary and potentially many MySQL replicas. Each MySQL instance within a shard has identical data (if we ignore any replication lag). The replicas can serve read-only traffic (with eventual consistency guarantees), execute long-running data analysis queries, or perform administrative tasks (backup, restore, diff, etc.). An *unsharded* keyspace is a keyspace with only a single shard. Vitess names the shard `0` (or sometimes `-`) by convention. When sharded, a keyspace has `N` shards with non-overlapping data. The number of shards in a keyspace can vary depending on the use-case and load characteristics, some Vitess users have hundreds of shards in some keyspaces. ## Shard Naming Shard names have the following characteristics: * They represent a range in unsigned integer space, where the left number is included, but the right is not. * Their notation is hexadecimal. * They are left justified, and right-padded with zeros. * A `-` prefix means: anything less than the right value. * A `-` postfix means: anything greater than or equal to the LHS value. * A plain `-` denotes the full keyrange. Thus: `-80` == `00-80` == `0000-8000` == `000000-800000` == `0000000000000000-8000000000000000` `80-` is not the same as `80-FF`. This is why: `80-FF` == `8000-FF00`. Therefore `FFFF` will be out of the `80-FF` range. `80-` means: ‘anything greater than or equal to `0x80` A `xxhash`
