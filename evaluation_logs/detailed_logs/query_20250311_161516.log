my.cnf `mysqlctl` **will not** read configuration files from common locations such as `/etc/my.cnf` or `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`. Instead, it will create a separate `my.cnf` config file using builtin defaults. The source files can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/main/config/mycnf). To add your own settings, you can set the `EXTRA_MY_CNF` environment variable to a list of colon-separated files. Alternatively, you can override the default behavior by specifying your own template file using the `-mysqlctl_mycnf_template` command line argument. For example, to override the default innodb buffer pool size, you would create a file named `/path/to/common.cnf` as follows: ```text innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G ``` And then launch mysqlctl with as follows: ```sh EXTRA_MY_CNF=”/path/to/common.cnf” mysqlctl \ --log_dir=${VTDATAROOT}/tmp \ --tablet_uid=100 \ --mysql_port=17100 \ init ``` When specifying additional configuration changes to Vitess, please keep in mind that changing the following settings is unsupported: | Setting | Reason | |---------------------|----------------| | `auto_commit` | MySQL autocommit needs to be turned on. VTTablet uses connection pools to MySQL. If autocommit is turned off, MySQL will start an implicit transaction (with a point in time snapshot) for each connection and will work very hard at keeping the current view unchanged, which would be counter-productive. | | `log-bin` | Several Vitess features rely on the binary log being
