QUESTION: Explain the role of the VTGate component in Vitess architecture. How does it help in query routing and load balancing?

ANSWER: ### Role of VTGate in Vitess Architecture
The VTGate component plays a crucial role in the Vitess architecture, acting as an entry point for client connections and responsible for query routing and load balancing.

### Query Routing
VTGate routes queries to the appropriate vttablet servers, taking into account factors such as:
* Shard information
* Tablet type (e.g., replica, rdonly)
* Replication lag

VTGate uses the following flags to control load-balancing of read queries for replicas:
* `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving`
* `discovery_low_replication_lag`
* `min_number_serving_vttablets`

These flags help VTGate determine which vttablets are healthy, degraded, or unhealthy based on their replication lag, and route queries accordingly.

### Load Balancing
VTGate uses a weighted average algorithm to exclude outliers and prefer vttablets with less lag when routing queries to degraded tablets. This approach ensures that queries are distributed efficiently across available vttablets, minimizing the impact of replication lag on query performance.

### Key Benefits
The VTGate component provides several key benefits, including:
* **Efficient query routing**: VTGate routes queries to the most suitable vttablets, reducing latency and improving overall system performance.
* **Load balancing**: VTGate distributes queries across available vttablets, ensuring that no single tablet is overwhelmed and becomes a bottleneck.
* **Replication lag management**: VTGate takes into account replication lag when routing queries, helping to maintain consistency and prevent data inconsistencies.

By acting as a central component in the Vitess architecture, VTGate enables efficient query routing and load balancing, making it an essential part of the Vitess system.

Defaults to true. * `--enable_consolidator_replicas`: Only enable query consolidation on non-primary tablets. * `--consolidator-query-waiter-cap`: The maximum number of clients allowed to wait on the consolidator for each query. No limit by default. ## Consistency It is important to note that in some cases read-after-write consistency can be lost. For example, if user1 issues a read query and user2 issues a write, that changes the result that the first read query would get, then user2 issues an identical read while user1's read is still executing. In this case the consolidator will kick in and user2 will get the result of user1's query thereby losing read-after-write consistency. If the application is sensitive to this behavior then you can specify that consolidation should be disabled on the primary using the following flags: `--enable_consolidator=false` and `--enable_consolidator_replicas=true` --- title: Read Query Load Balancing weight: 12 --- For applications which scale out read queries using replicas, Vitess can safely avoid sending queries to replicas with replication lag beyond acceptable thresholds. ## Flags You can set the following flags on VTGate to control load-balancing of read queries for replicas: * `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving`: If the replication lag of a vttablet exceeds this value, vtgate will treat it as unhealthy and will not send queries to it. This value is meant to match vttablet’s `unhealthy_threshold` value. * `discovery_low_replication_lag`: If a single vttablet lags beyond this value, vtgate will not send it any queries. However, if too many replicas exceed this threshold, then vtgate will send queries to the ones that have the least lag. A weighted average algorithm is used to exclude the outliers. This value is meant to match vttablet’s `degraded_threshold` value. * `min_number_serving_vttablets`: The minimum number of vttablets for each replicating tablet type (e.g. replica, rdonly) that will continue to be used even with replication lag above `discovery_low_replication_lag`, but still below `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving`. Be aware that there are VTTablet settings that impact the functionality of these flags, discussed in the section below. ## Replication Lag and Query Routing From a replication lag perspective, a tablet can be considered to be in three states for read-only routing: healthy, degraded, and unhealthy. Unhealthy tablets receive no queries. Degraded tablets will only receive queries if absolutely necessary. Healthy tablets will always receive queries. Degraded tablets (those with replication lag above `discovery_low_replication_lag`) will only receive queries when there are fewer than `min_number_serving_vttablets` non-degraded tablets available (within same shard, same tablet type, etc) for queries. Above that point, a weighted average algorithm is used to determine which replica should serve queries, prefering those with less lag. {{< info >}} If there are only 2 replicas for a given replication group and tablet type and `min_number_serving_vttablets` is set to the default of 2, the only portion of this logic that will apply is the unhealthy threshold set by `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` at which point the replica will receive no queries. To get the other behaviors requires either more tablets or reducing `min_number_serving_vttablets`. {{< /info >}} The replication lag thresholds at which tablets are considered degraded or unhealthy

and robust SQL (Structured Query Language) database server. However, MySQL starts running into limitations with large data sizes or large numbers of concurrent users. Vitess is a database scaling system designed to be used with MySQL. It enables deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of MySQL instances with built-in sharding, high availability and connection pooling. ## How is Vitess different from RDS for MySQL? RDS for MySQL is a managed service from AWS which has many of the same limitations as open source or enterprise MySQL. ## How is Vitess different from AWS Aurora for MySQL? AWS Aurora for MySQL is a managed service from AWS which can scale beyond the limitations of RDS for MySQL. However, it cannot scale to the same extent as Vitess. ## Are foreign keys supported in Vitess? We generally discourage the use of foreign keys, and more specifically foreign key constraints. There may be unexpected consequences when using them in sharded keyspaces. However, you can use foreign key constraints when their scope is contained within a shard or unsharded keyspace. You will need to [configure](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/vschema-guide/foreign-keys/) Vitess with the desired level of support. Please note that if you do shard or re-shard an existing keyspqce with foreign keys, you will need to take extra steps to confirm they are working as intended. --- title: Components weight: 3 --- ## What is VTGate and how does it work? VTGate is a lightweight proxy server that sits between your application and your shards, which contain your data. VTGates are essentially stateless and in many cases, you can scale with query load by adding more VTGate instances. Some of the main functions performed by VTGate are as follows: * Keeps track of the Vitess cluster state, and route traffic accordingly. * Parses SQL queries fully, and combines that understanding with Vitess VSchema to direct queries to the appropriate VTTablet (or set of VTTablets) and returns consolidated results back to the client. * Supports both the MySQL Protocol and the gRPC protocol. Thus, your applications can connect to VTGate as if it is a MySQL Server. * Is aware of failovers in underlying shards, and performs buffering of queries to reduce application impact. ## What is VTTablet? How does it work with MySQL? A VTTablet is the Vitess component that both front-ends and, optionally, controls a running MySQL server. It accepts queries over gRPC and translates the queries back to MySQL, as well as speaking to MySQL to issue commands to control replication, take backups, etc. Things to note about VTTablet are: * Each mysqld needs a VTTablet that manages it. * VTTablet tracks long running queries and kills them when they exceed a defined threshold. * The combination of a VTTablet process and a MySQL process is called a Tablet. Please note that in some cases VTTablets may be deployed as [unmanaged/remote or partially managed](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/programs/vttablet/#managed-mysql). The recommendation is to start with unmanaged mode but eventually migrate to managed mode. Operations like resharding are possible only with vitess-managed MySQL

usually running on the same machine. Each tablet is assigned a tablet type, which specifies what role it currently performs. The main tablet types are listed below: * PRIMARY - A tablet that contains a MySQL instance that is currently the MySQL primary for its shard. * REPLICA - A tablet that contains a MySQL replica that is eligible to be promoted to primary. Conventionally, these are reserved for serving live, user-facing read-only requests (like from the website’s frontend). * RDONLY - A tablet that contains a MySQL replica that cannot be promoted to primary. Conventionally, these are used for background processing jobs, such as taking backups, dumping data to other systems, heavy analytical queries, and resharding. There are some other tablet types like `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`. For information on how to use tablets please review this [user guide](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/vttablet-mysql/). ## What is a shard? A shard is a physical division within a keyspace; i.e. how data is split across multiple MySQL instances. A shard typically consists of one MySQL primary and one or more MySQL replicas. Each MySQL instance within a shard has the same data, if the effect of MySQL replication lag is ignored. The replicas can serve read-only traffic, execute long-running queries from data analysis tools, or perform administrative tasks. An unsharded keyspace always has only a single shard. --- title: Metrics weight: 7 --- ## How can I monitor or get metrics from Vitess? All Vitess components have a web UI that you can access to see the state of each component. The first place to look is the `/debug/status` page. * This is the main landing page for a VTGate, which displays the status of a particular server. A list of tablets this VTGate process is connected to is also displayed, as this is the list of tablets that can potentially serve queries. A second place to look is the `/debug/vars` page. For example, for VTGate, this page contains the following items: * VTGateApi - This is the main histogram variable to track for VTGates. It gives you a breakdown of all queries by command, keyspace, and type. * HealthcheckConnections - It shows the number of tablet connections for query/healthcheck per keyspace, shard, and tablet type. There are two other pages you can use to get monitoring information from Vitess in the VTGate web UI: * `/debug/query_plans` - This URL gives you all the query plans for queries going through VTGate. * `/debug/vschema` - This URL shows the VSchema as loaded by VTGate. VTTablet has a similar web UI. Vitess component metrics can also be scraped via /metrics. This will provide a Prometheus-format metric dump that is updated continuously. This is the recommended way to collect metrics from Vitess. ## How do you integrate Prometheus and Vitess? There is an Prometheus exporter that is on by default that enables you to configure a Prometheus compatible scraper to grab data from the various Vitess components. All Vitess components export their metrics on their http port at `/metrics`.

is used for routing queries, and also during resharding operations. For a Keyspace, you can specify if it's sharded or not. For sharded keyspaces, you can specify the list of vindexes for each table. Vitess also supports [sequence generators](../../reference/features/vitess-sequences/) that can be used to generate new ids that work like MySQL auto increment columns. The VSchema allows you to associate table columns to sequence tables. If no value is specified for such a column, then VTGate will know to use the sequence table to generate a new value for it. --- title: VStream --- VStream is a change notification service accessible via VTGate. The purpose of VStream is to provide equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards of the Vitess cluster. gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, can subscribe to a VStream to receive change events from other shards. The VStream pulls events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This allows for efficient execution of functions such as VReplication where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards, and then apply it to a target instance. A user can leverage VStream to obtain in-depth information about data change events for a given Vitess keyspace, shard, and position. A single VStream can also consolidate change events from multiple shards in a keyspace, making it a convenient tool to feed a CDC (Change Data Capture) process downstream from your Vitess datastore. For reference, please refer to the diagram below: ![VStream diagram](/img/VStream.svg) Note: A VStream is distinct from a VStreamer. The former is located on the VTGate and the latter is located on the VTTablet. --- title: VTAdmin --- ## VTAdmin VTAdmin is a component in Vitess that serves as a centralized management and administration tool for Vitess clusters. ## Purpose VTAdmin provides a unified interface for database administrators to monitor, manage, and maintain Vitess deployments. ## Key Features * Cluster Visualization: Offers a visual representation of the Vitess cluster topology. * Monitoring: Provides real-time insights into cluster performance and health. * Schema Management: Allows viewing Schema and [VSchema](../../reference/features/vschema). ## How VTAdmin Works VTAdmin is a centralized, web-based interface that simplifies the management and monitoring of Vitess clusters by integrating closely with [VTCtld](../../reference/programs/vtctld) instances. It provides a unified view of keyspaces, shards, and tablets, enabling administrators to monitor tablet health, manage multiple clusters, and control [VReplication](../../reference/vreplication "VReplication Documentation") workflows such as [Reshard](../../reference/vreplication/reshard/) and [MoveTables](../../reference/vreplication/movetables/). The interface includes query execution tools for performance analysis and debugging, featuring the embedded [VTExplain](../../reference/programs/vtexplain) tool to help users optimize SQL queries and understand execution plans. VTAdmin helps users and operators by facilitating efficient operations and effective management of distributed Vitess environments.
