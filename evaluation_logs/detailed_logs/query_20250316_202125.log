QUESTION: What is the purpose of VStream in Vitess, and how does it facilitate change data capture (CDC)?

ANSWER: ### Purpose of VStream in Vitess
The purpose of VStream in Vitess is to provide a change notification service, allowing clients to receive change events from the underlying MySQL shards.

### How VStream Facilitates CDC
VStream facilitates change data capture (CDC) by pulling events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This enables efficient execution of functions such as VReplication, where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards and apply them to a target instance.

### Key Benefits of VStream
The key benefits of VStream include:
* Providing equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards
* Allowing gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, to subscribe to a VStream and receive change events
* Enabling efficient execution of functions such as VReplication

In summary, VStream is a crucial component in Vitess that facilitates change data capture (CDC) by providing a change notification service, allowing clients to receive change events from the underlying MySQL shards.

on how you optimized your sharding keys. ## When do I need to use a VSchema? For a very trivial setup where there is only one unsharded keyspace, there is no need to specify a VSchema because Vitess will know that there is nowhere to route a query except to the single shard. However, once you have sharding, having a VSchema becomes a necessity. This is because a VSchema is needed to locate and place rows in each table in a sharded keyspace. The Vitess distribution has a demo of VSchema operation [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/examples/demo). --- title: Getting Started docs_nav_disable_expand: true weight: 1 --- --- title: Advanced Migrations weight: 2 --- ## How do I migrate to Vitess from a hosted MySQL? If you are running a hosted MySQL like RDS on AWS, CloudSQL on GCP, or Azure managed MySQL, because you are not coming from MySQL you have to use either the ‘Stop-the-world’ method or the method using VReplication setup in front of the existing external database. You can read more about those two methods [here](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/migration/migrate-data/). There is no option to do an application level migration. The biggest challenge with this sort of migration is you must be able to access the source database from the location where you want to put the target database. You will need to ensure this configuration constraint is resolved and set up prior to any sort of migration. ## What is Vstream and how does it work? VStream is a change notification service accessible via VTGate. The purpose of VStream is to provide equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards. gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, can subscribe to a VStream to receive change events from other shards. The VStream pulls events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This allows for efficient execution of functions such as VReplication where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards, and then apply it to a target instance. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## How do I migrate my data to Vitess? There are two main parts to migrating your data to Vitess: migrating the actual data and repointing the application. The answer here will focus primarily on the methods that can be used to migrate your data into Vitess. There are three different methods to migrate your data into Vitess. Choosing the appropriate option depends on several factors like: - The nature of the application accessing the MySQL database - The size of the MySQL database to be migrated - The load, especially the write load, on the MySQL database - Your tolerance for downtime during the migration of data - Whether you require the ability to reverse the migration if need be - The network level configuration of your components The three different methods are: - ‘Stop-the-world’ - VReplication from Vitess setup in

is used for routing queries, and also during resharding operations. For a Keyspace, you can specify if it's sharded or not. For sharded keyspaces, you can specify the list of vindexes for each table. Vitess also supports [sequence generators](../../reference/features/vitess-sequences/) that can be used to generate new ids that work like MySQL auto increment columns. The VSchema allows you to associate table columns to sequence tables. If no value is specified for such a column, then VTGate will know to use the sequence table to generate a new value for it. --- title: VStream --- VStream is a change notification service accessible via VTGate. The purpose of VStream is to provide equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards of the Vitess cluster. gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, can subscribe to a VStream to receive change events from other shards. The VStream pulls events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This allows for efficient execution of functions such as VReplication where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards, and then apply it to a target instance. A user can leverage VStream to obtain in-depth information about data change events for a given Vitess keyspace, shard, and position. A single VStream can also consolidate change events from multiple shards in a keyspace, making it a convenient tool to feed a CDC (Change Data Capture) process downstream from your Vitess datastore. For reference, please refer to the diagram below: ![VStream diagram](/img/VStream.svg) Note: A VStream is distinct from a VStreamer. The former is located on the VTGate and the latter is located on the VTTablet. --- title: VTAdmin --- ## VTAdmin VTAdmin is a component in Vitess that serves as a centralized management and administration tool for Vitess clusters. ## Purpose VTAdmin provides a unified interface for database administrators to monitor, manage, and maintain Vitess deployments. ## Key Features * Cluster Visualization: Offers a visual representation of the Vitess cluster topology. * Monitoring: Provides real-time insights into cluster performance and health. * Schema Management: Allows viewing Schema and [VSchema](../../reference/features/vschema). ## How VTAdmin Works VTAdmin is a centralized, web-based interface that simplifies the management and monitoring of Vitess clusters by integrating closely with [VTCtld](../../reference/programs/vtctld) instances. It provides a unified view of keyspaces, shards, and tablets, enabling administrators to monitor tablet health, manage multiple clusters, and control [VReplication](../../reference/vreplication "VReplication Documentation") workflows such as [Reshard](../../reference/vreplication/reshard/) and [MoveTables](../../reference/vreplication/movetables/). The interface includes query execution tools for performance analysis and debugging, featuring the embedded [VTExplain](../../reference/programs/vtexplain) tool to help users optimize SQL queries and understand execution plans. VTAdmin helps users and operators by facilitating efficient operations and effective management of distributed Vitess environments.

if there is a problem, the `Last Message` column will display the error. Sometimes, it's possible that the stream cannot find a source. If so, the `Source Tablet` would be empty. ### VTTablet Logfile If the errors are not clear or if they keep disappearing, the VTTablet's INFO logfile will contain information about what it's been doing with each stream. ### Workflow Show The current status of the workflows and streams can also be fetched by using the `vtctldclient` [`Workflow Show`](../workflow/) command. ### Monitoring Variables VReplication also reports [a set of metrics](../metrics/) that can be scraped by monitoring tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). Thresholds and alerts can be set to draw attention to potential problems. --- title: VStream description: Change event streams weight: 75 aliases: ['/docs/design-docs/vreplication/vstream/vscopy/'] --- [Vitess Gateways](../../../concepts/vtgate/) (`vtgate`) provide a [`VStream` service](../../../concepts/vstream/) that allows clients to subscribe to a change event stream for a set of tables. ## Use Cases * **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: `VStream` can be used to capture changes to a table and send them to a downstream system. This is useful for building real-time data pipelines. ## Overview `VStream` supports copying the current contents of a table — as you will often not have the binary logs going back to the creation of the table — and then begin streaming new changes to the table from that point on. It supports resuming this initial copy phase if it's interrupted for any reason. It also supports automatic handling of [resharding events](../reshard/) — if the `VStream` is connected throughout then it will automatically transition from the old shards to the new when traffic is switched ([`SwitchTraffic` or `ReverseTraffic`](../reshard/#switchtraffic)), and if you were not connected but re-connect after traffic is switched ([`SwitchTraffic` or `ReverseTraffic`](../reshard/#switchtraffic)) *but before the old shards are removed*, it will automatically catch up on any missed changes on the old shards before seamlessly transitioning to the new shards and continuing to stream all changes made there. Events in the stream are [MySQL row based binary log events](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/mysqlbinlog-row-events.html) — with [extended metadata](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#VEvent) — and can be processed by event bridges which support Vitess such as [Debezium](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html). Other products such as [AirByte](https://airbyte.com) can also be used with [custom Vitess connectors](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/). {{< warning >}} We recommend Debezium as it has native Vitess support and has been used in production environments by many Vitess users. {{< /warning >}} ## API Details [`VStream` is a gRPC](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/vtgate/vtgateconn#VTGateConn.VStream) that is part of the [`vtgate`](../../../concepts/vtgate/) service and is accessible via a [`vtgate`](../../../concepts/vtgate/) process's `--grpc_port`. ### RPC Parameters #### Context **Type** [Context](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context)\ **Required**\ **Default** none In addition to the typical `Context` usage, it can contain a custom key-value pair where the key is `1` and the value is a [`CallerID`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/vtrpc#CallerID). This value is then passed along to [tablets](../../../concepts/tablet/) to identify the originating client for the request. It is not meant to be secure, but primarily informational. The client can provide whatever info they want in the [`CallerID`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/vtrpc#CallerID) fields and they will be trusted by the servers as this information is primarily used to aid in

be kept up-to-date in real time. One can also materialize reference tables onto all shards for improved data locality, allowing Vitess to perform efficient local joins with those materialized tables. * **Realtime Rollups**: Use [`Materialize`](../materialize/) with aggregation expressions in which case Vitess will create a rolled up version of the source table which can be used for realtime analytics. * **Lookup Vindexes**: Use the [`LookupVindex`](../../../reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_lookupvindex/) command to create and backfill Lookup Vindexes. See the [`Creating a Lookup Vindex`](../../../user-guides/vschema-guide/backfill-vindexes/#createlookupvindex) section of the vschema user guide for example usage. * **Online Schema Changes**: Use a [`ddl strategy of vitess`](../../../user-guides/schema-changes/ddl-strategies/) for native [online non-blocking schema migrations](../../../user-guides/schema-changes/managed-online-schema-changes/) that are trackable, cancellable, revertible, and retryable. All being safe to run in production due to intelligent throttling and resource management. * **Change Notifications (CDC)**: The [`VStream`](../../../concepts/vstream/) component of VReplication can be used for the application or a systems operator to subscribe to change notifications and use it to keep downstream systems up-to-date with the source. * **Job Queues**: VReplication can also be used to provide a job queue for asynchronous processing of data using the [Messaging](../../features/messaging/) feature. ## Feature Description VReplication works as [a stream or set of streams](../internal/life-of-a-stream/). Each stream establishes replication from a source keyspace/shard to a target keyspace/shard. A given stream can replicate multiple tables. For each table, you can specify a `SELECT` statement that represents both the transformation rule and the filtering rule. The `SELECT` expressions specify the transformation, and the `WHERE` clause specifies the filtering. The `SELECT` expressions can be any non-aggregate MySQL expression, or they can also be `COUNT` or `SUM` as aggregate expressions. Aggregate expressions combined with the corresponding `GROUP BY` clauses will allow you to materialize real-time rollups of the source table, which can be used for analytics. The target table can have a different name from the source. For a sharded system like Vitess, multiple VReplication streams may be needed to achieve the objective. This is because there can be multiple source shards and multiple destination shards, and the relationship between them may not be one to one. VReplication performs the following essential functions: * [Copy data](../internal/life-of-a-stream/#copy) from the source to the destination table in a consistent fashion. For a large table, this copy can be long-running. It can be interrupted and resumed. If interrupted, VReplication can keep the copied portion up-to-date with respect to the source, and it can resume the copy process at a point that is consistent with the current replication position. * After copying is finished, it can continuously [replicate](../internal/life-of-a-stream/#replicate) the data from the source to destination. * The copying rule can be expressed as a `SELECT` statement. The statement should be simple enough that the materialized table can be kept up-to-date from the data coming from the binlog. For example, joins in the `SELECT` statement are not supported today. * Correctness verification: VReplication supports the [VDiff](../vdiff) command which verifies that the target table is an exact representation of the `SELECT` statement from the source by capturing consistent snapshots of the source and
