QUESTION: What is a keyspace in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### Keyspace in Vitess

A **keyspace** is a logical database in Vitess. It typically maps to multiple MySQL instances, regardless of sharding, and appears as a single database from the application's viewpoint. This means that a keyspace can contain multiple shards, and Vitess handles the distribution of data across these shards. 

In essence, a keyspace is the highest-level namespace in Vitess, and it provides a way to organize and manage related data across multiple MySQL instances. Reading data from a keyspace is similar to reading from a MySQL database.

of a VTTablet process and a MySQL process is called a Tablet. Please note that in some cases VTTablets may be deployed as [unmanaged/remote or partially managed](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/programs/vttablet/#managed-mysql). The recommendation is to start with unmanaged mode but eventually migrate to managed mode. Operations like resharding are possible only with vitess-managed MySQL servers. ## What is VTCtld? VTCtld is a Vitess server component that can perform various Vitess cluster- and component-level operations on behalf of an administrative user. You can interact with VTCtld via a web UI, or via an gRPC interface using the vtctldclient CLI tool. It has an administrative UI called VTAdmin. Some of the administrative actions VTCtld can perform include: reparents (failovers), backups, shard splits, resharding, and shard merges. ## What is a keyspace? A keyspace is a logical database. Typically, a keyspace maps to multiple MySQL instances regardless of sharding. This is because it is recommended to run multiple replicas even for an unsharded keyspace. In other words, a keyspace appears as a single database from the application's viewpoint. Reading data from a keyspace is just like reading from a MySQL database. ## What is vtctldclient? This is a Vitess CLI used to execute gRPC commands against VTCtld. It is the most common way to perform administrative commands against a running Vitess cluster. ## What is a cell? How does it work? A cell is a group of servers and associated network infrastructure co-located in an area, and isolated from failures in other cells. It is typically either a full data center or a subset of a data center, sometimes called a zone or availability zone. Vitess gracefully handles cell-level failures, such as when a cell is isolated from other cells by a network failure. A useful way to think of a cell is as a failure domain.

keyspace and all queries are sent to it. 2. Connect to Vitess without specifying a keyspace (unspecified mode), but use qualified names for tables, like `keyspace.table` in your queries. However, once the setup exceeds the above complexity, VSchemas become a necessity. Vitess has a [working demo](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/main/examples/demo) of VSchemas. ## Sharding Model In Vitess, a `keyspace` is sharded by `keyspace ID` ranges. Each row is assigned a keyspace ID, which acts like a street address, and it determines the shard where the row lives. In some respect, one could say that the `keyspace ID` is the equivalent of a NoSQL sharding key. However, there are some differences: 1. The `keyspace ID` is a concept that is internal to Vitess. The application does not need to know anything about it. 2. There is no physical column that stores the actual `keyspace ID`. This value is computed as needed. This difference is significant enough that we do not refer to the keyspace ID as the sharding key. A [Primary Vindex](../vindexes/#the-primary-vindex) more closely resembles the NoSQL sharding key. Mapping to a `keyspace ID`, and then to a shard, gives us the flexibility to reshard the data with minimal disruption because the `keyspace ID` of each row remains unchanged through the process. ## Vindexes The Vschema contains the [Vindex](../vindexes) for any sharded tables. The Vindex tells Vitess where to find the shard that contains a particular row for a sharded table. Every VSchema must have at least one Vindex, called the [Primary Vindex](../vindexes/#the-primary-vindex), defined. The Primary Vindex is unique: given an input value, it produces a single keyspace ID, or value in the keyspace used to shard the table. The Primary Vindex is typically a functional Vindex: Vitess computes the keyspace ID as needed from a column in the sharded table. ## Sequences Auto-increment columns

multiple data centers and regions. Vitess achieves this goal by allowing the application to connect to any VTGate server, and that server gives you the semblance of being connected to a single MySQL server. The metadata that maps the logical view to the physical MySQL servers is stored in the topology. In this logical view, a Vitess keyspace is the equivalent of a MySQL database. In many cases, this is a one-to-one mapping where a keyspace directly corresponds to a physical MySQL server with a single database. However, a Vitess keyspace can also be sharded. If so, a single keyspace would map to multiple MySQL servers behind the scenes. The topology is typically spread across multiple Topo Servers: The Global Topo server contains global information, like the list of keyspaces, shards and cells. This information gets deployed into cell-specific topo servers. Each cell-specific Topo Server contains additional information about vttablets and MySQL servers running in that cell. With this architecture, an outage in one cell does not affect other cells. The topo also stores a VSchema for each keyspace. For an unsharded keyspace, the vschema is a simple list of table names. If a keyspace is sharded, then it must contain additional metadata about the sharding scheme for each table, and how they relate to each other. When a query is received by VTGate, the information in the vschema is used to make decisions about how to serve the query. In some cases, it will result in the query being routed to a single shard. In other cases, it could result in the query being sent to all shards, etc. This guide explains how to build vschemas for Vitess keyspaces. ### Demo To illustrate the various features of the VSchema, we will make use of the [demo app](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/main/examples/demo).
