QUESTION: What is a primary Vindex and how does it work?

ANSWER: ### Primary Vindex Overview
A Primary Vindex is a unique identifier for a table in Vitess, similar to a database primary key. It is a crucial component that determines how data is sharded across different shards.

### How Primary Vindex Works
The Primary Vindex is used to map a column value to a keyspace ID, which identifies the shard where the data is stored. When a new row is inserted into a sharded table, the Primary Vindex is used to compute the keyspace ID, determining the target shard for the inserted data.

**Key Characteristics:**

* The Primary Vindex must be unique, meaning it must produce a single keyspace ID for a given input value.
* It is typically a functional Vindex, where Vitess computes the keyspace ID as needed from a column in the sharded table.
* Every sharded table must have a Primary Vindex defined, which is used to route queries and perform resharding operations.

contains the information needed to make Vitess look and act like a single database server. For example, the VSchema will contain the sharding key for each sharded table. When the application issues a query with a WHERE clause that references the key, the VSchema will be used to route the query to the appropriate shard. ## What is a Vindex and how does it work? A Vindex provides a way to map a column value to a keyspace ID. Since each shard in Vitess covers a range of keyspace ID values, this mapping can be used to identify which shard contains a row. The advantages of Vindexes stem from their flexibility: * A table can have multiple Vindexes. * Vindexes can be NonUnique, which allows a column value to yield multiple keyspace IDs. * Vindexes can be a simple function or be based on a lookup table. * Vindexes can be shared across multiple tables. * Custom Vindexes can be created and used, and Vitess will still know how to reshard using such Vindexes. The Vschema contains the Vindex for any sharded tables. Every Vschema must have at least one Vindex, called the Primary Vindex, defined. A variety of other Vindexes are also available to choose from, with different trade-offs, and you can choose one that best suits your needs. You can read more about other Vindexes [here](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vindexes/). ## What is a primary Vindex and how does it work? The Primary Vindex for a table is analogous to a database primary key. Every sharded table must have one defined.

Primary Vindex is unique: given an input value, it produces a single keyspace ID, or value in the keyspace used to shard the table. The Primary Vindex is typically a functional Vindex: Vitess computes the keyspace ID as needed from a column in the sharded table. ## Sequences Auto-increment columns do not work very well for sharded tables. [Vitess sequences](../vitess-sequences) solve this problem. Sequence tables must be specified in the VSchema, and then tied to table columns. At the time of insert, if no value is specified for such a column, VTGate will generate a number for it using the sequence table. ## Reference tables Vitess allows you to create an unsharded table and deploy it into all shards of a sharded keyspace. The data in such a table is assumed to be identical for all shards. In this case, you can specify that the table is of type `reference`, and should not specify any vindex for it. Any joins of this table with an unsharded table will be treated as a local join. Typically, such a table has a canonical source in an unsharded keyspace, and the copies in the sharded keyspace are kept up-to-date through VReplication. ## Per-Keyspace VSchema The VSchema uses a flexible proto JSON format. Essentially, you can use `snake_case` or `camelCase` for the keys. The configuration of your VSchema reflects the desired sharding configuration for your database, including whether or not your tables are sharded and whether you want to implement a secondary Vindex. ### Commands You can use the following commands for maintaining the VSchema: * `GetVSchema <keyspace>` * `ApplyVSchema -- {--vschema=<vschema> || --vschema_file=<vschema file> || --sql=<sql> || --sql_file=<sql file>} [--cells=c1,c2,...] [--skip_rebuild] [--dry-run] [--strict] <keyspace>` * `RebuildVSchemaGraph [--cells=c1,c2,...]` * `GetSrvVSchema <cell>` * `DeleteSrvVSchema <cell>` In order to verify that a VTGate has loaded SrvVSchema

primary key. Every sharded table must have one defined. A Primary Vindex must be unique: given an input value, it must produce a single keyspace ID. At the time of an insert to the table, the unique mapping produced by the Primary Vindex determines the target shard for the inserted row. In Vitess, the choice of Vindex allows control of how a column value maps to a keyspace ID. In other words, a Primary Vindex in Vitess not only defines the Sharding Key, but also decides the Sharding Strategy. Uniqueness for a Primary Vindex does not mean that the column has to be a primary key or unique key in the MySQL schema for the underlying shard. You can have multiple rows that map to the same keyspace ID. The Vindex uniqueness constraint only ensures that all rows for a keyspace ID end up in the same shard. ## How do I create a VSchema? The ease of creation of a VSchema depends heavily on now your data model is constructed. For some data models, especially smaller and less complex ones, it can be less challenging to determine how to split the data between shards. A clear sharding key would be a column that is on most of the tables in your data model. If there is a clear sharding key then creating VSchema is as straightforward as specifying that column as the primary Vindex for each table. Common primary Vindexes tend to be user ID or customer ID. For more complex data models most will have to investigate the patterns of common queries in order to determine what sharding keys to use. When investigating the most common queries you must identify what you want to optimize, as this influences heavily the determination of the sharding keys. For example if
