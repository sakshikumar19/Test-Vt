QUESTION: How do Vitess replicas stay in sync?

ANSWER: ### Vitess Replicas Synchronization
Vitess replicas stay in sync through normal MySQL replication. Each shard in Vitess uses MySQL replication to replicate changes from the primary shard to the replica(s). 

**Key Replication Methods:**

* Asynchronous MySQL replication (default)
* Semi-synchronous MySQL replication (configurable) for data durability in the presence of failures

**Note:** VReplication is not used directly to keep replicas in sync with a primary. Instead, it is used internally in Vitess for features like resharding, migrating tables across keyspaces, and materialized views.

regular backups in order to migrate out of Vitess. This method is performed directly on the tablet servers and is more efficient and safer for databases of any significant size. The downside is that this is a physical MySQL instance backup, and needs to be restored accordingly. Both mysqldump and go-mydumper are not typically suitable for production backups. This is because Vitess does not implement all the locking constructs across a sharded database that are necessary to do a consistent logical backup while writing to the database. However, it may be appropriate if you are able to stop all writes to Vitess for the period that the dump process is running; or you are just backing up tables that are not receiving any writes. You can read more about exporting data from Vitess [here](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/configuration-basic/exporting-data/). ## How do Vitess replicas stay in sync? Do replicas use VReplication? Every shard in Vitess uses normal MySQL replication to replicate changes from the primary for that shard to the replica(s). Vitess can use asynchronous MySQL replication (the default), but can also be configured to use semi-synchronous MySQL replication in order to provide data durability in the presence of failures. VReplication is used internally in Vitess for features like resharding, migrating tables across keyspaces, and materialized views. It is not used directly to keep replicas in sync with a primary. ## What are the main components of Vitess? Vitess consists of a number of server processes and command-line utilities and is backed by a consistent metadata store. The main server components consist of: * VTGate * Topology server (etcd) * VTCtld * Tablets which are made up of VTTablets and mysqld The diagram below illustrates Vitess’ components and their location within Vitess’ architecture: <img alt="Vitess Components" src="/img/vitess-components.png" width=100%> ## Are microservices recommended for scaling?

It is defined in go/vt/topo/helpers/tee.go. It allows communicating to two topo services, and the migration uses multiple phases. This process is explained in Vitess’ documentation [here](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/topology-service/#migration-using-the-tee-implementation). --- title: VReplication weight: 6 --- ## What is VReplication? How does it work? VReplication is used as a building block for a number of features in Vitess. It works as a stream or combination of streams that establish replication from a source keyspace/shard into a target keyspace/shard. A given stream can replicate multiple tables. It allows Vitess to keep the data being copied in-sync by using a combination of copying rows and filtered replication. VReplication works via the following process: 1. It first analyzes the source table on the source shard and identifies what rows it needs to copy. 2. It then very briefly locks the table and records the current GTID replication position on the source database. After recording the current GTID position, VReplication then unlocks the table again. 3. It selects all rows and columns that match a specified filter from GTID value 0 onward and makes a copy of the results. 4. It then streams the copy over to the target shard to start inserting rows. VReplication will keep copying for a specified period of time (default 1 hour), to attempt to finish the copy. 5. If the copying phase on the target hasn’t finished in an hour, it will stop and go back to the table in order to pick up any changes that have been made since it started copying. 6. It knows what the GTID was when it started copying and what the GTID is now. This enables it to determine what events have occurred after it performed the first select and copy. 7. It will then filter out all the events except the ones that pertain

/info >}} ## Moving to a different TopoServer It is generally not recommended that you migrate from one type of toposerver to another. However, if absolutely necessary, you can use the [topo2topo](../../../reference/features/topology-service/#migration-between-implementations) command line tool to perform this migration. ## Backups It is important to periodically backup the data in the TopoServer. Although most of the information in the TopoServer can be manually reconstructed, it is still a painful task. This can be avoided if a recent backup was readily available. ## Checklist * Ensure toposerver is up, and that you can set and get values using their provided client tools. * Ensure you have the mechanism to include the correct topo flags for all the components: `--topo_implementation`, `--topo_global_server_address` and `--topo_global_root`. * If using zookeeper, ensure the global root path is created. It may be beneficial to do the same for etcd also. * Ensure that the servers are reachable from other parts of the system where Vitess components will be launched. --- title: Initialize Shard Primary weight: 9 --- A new primary is elected automatically by VTOrc and no user action is required. The InitShardPrimary command can be used to do the same operation manually. However, it is a destructive command and should only be used by advanced users. This command copies over the `executed_gtid_set` from the primary to the replica which can break replication if the user isn't careful. The command for `InitShardPrimary` is as follows: ```text vtctldclient \ InitShardPrimary \ --force \ commerce/0 \ cell1-100 ``` Until this step is complete, you may see errors like this in the vttablet logs: `Cannot start query service: Unknown database 'vt_xxx'`. This is because the database will be created only after a primary is elected. If you have semi-sync enabled and did not set up at least two replicas, InitShardPrimary
