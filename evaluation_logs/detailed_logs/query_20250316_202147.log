QUESTION: How does VTGate route queries to the appropriate VTTablet servers in Vitess?

ANSWER: ### VTGate Query Routing in Vitess
VTGate routes queries to the appropriate VTTablet servers in Vitess by:
* Keeping track of the Vitess cluster state
* Parsing SQL queries fully
* Combining the understanding of the SQL queries with the Vitess VSchema to direct queries to the appropriate VTTablet (or set of VTTablets)
* Returning consolidated results back to the client

This process allows VTGate to efficiently route queries to the correct VTTablet servers, ensuring that queries are executed correctly and results are returned to the client.

and robust SQL (Structured Query Language) database server. However, MySQL starts running into limitations with large data sizes or large numbers of concurrent users. Vitess is a database scaling system designed to be used with MySQL. It enables deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of MySQL instances with built-in sharding, high availability and connection pooling. ## How is Vitess different from RDS for MySQL? RDS for MySQL is a managed service from AWS which has many of the same limitations as open source or enterprise MySQL. ## How is Vitess different from AWS Aurora for MySQL? AWS Aurora for MySQL is a managed service from AWS which can scale beyond the limitations of RDS for MySQL. However, it cannot scale to the same extent as Vitess. ## Are foreign keys supported in Vitess? We generally discourage the use of foreign keys, and more specifically foreign key constraints. There may be unexpected consequences when using them in sharded keyspaces. However, you can use foreign key constraints when their scope is contained within a shard or unsharded keyspace. You will need to [configure](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/vschema-guide/foreign-keys/) Vitess with the desired level of support. Please note that if you do shard or re-shard an existing keyspqce with foreign keys, you will need to take extra steps to confirm they are working as intended. --- title: Components weight: 3 --- ## What is VTGate and how does it work? VTGate is a lightweight proxy server that sits between your application and your shards, which contain your data. VTGates are essentially stateless and in many cases, you can scale with query load by adding more VTGate instances. Some of the main functions performed by VTGate are as follows: * Keeps track of the Vitess cluster state, and route traffic accordingly. * Parses SQL queries fully, and combines that understanding with Vitess VSchema to direct queries to the appropriate VTTablet (or set of VTTablets) and returns consolidated results back to the client. * Supports both the MySQL Protocol and the gRPC protocol. Thus, your applications can connect to VTGate as if it is a MySQL Server. * Is aware of failovers in underlying shards, and performs buffering of queries to reduce application impact. ## What is VTTablet? How does it work with MySQL? A VTTablet is the Vitess component that both front-ends and, optionally, controls a running MySQL server. It accepts queries over gRPC and translates the queries back to MySQL, as well as speaking to MySQL to issue commands to control replication, take backups, etc. Things to note about VTTablet are: * Each mysqld needs a VTTablet that manages it. * VTTablet tracks long running queries and kills them when they exceed a defined threshold. * The combination of a VTTablet process and a MySQL process is called a Tablet. Please note that in some cases VTTablets may be deployed as [unmanaged/remote or partially managed](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/programs/vttablet/#managed-mysql). The recommendation is to start with unmanaged mode but eventually migrate to managed mode. Operations like resharding are possible only with vitess-managed MySQL

on how you optimized your sharding keys. ## When do I need to use a VSchema? For a very trivial setup where there is only one unsharded keyspace, there is no need to specify a VSchema because Vitess will know that there is nowhere to route a query except to the single shard. However, once you have sharding, having a VSchema becomes a necessity. This is because a VSchema is needed to locate and place rows in each table in a sharded keyspace. The Vitess distribution has a demo of VSchema operation [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/master/examples/demo). --- title: Getting Started docs_nav_disable_expand: true weight: 1 --- --- title: Advanced Migrations weight: 2 --- ## How do I migrate to Vitess from a hosted MySQL? If you are running a hosted MySQL like RDS on AWS, CloudSQL on GCP, or Azure managed MySQL, because you are not coming from MySQL you have to use either the ‘Stop-the-world’ method or the method using VReplication setup in front of the existing external database. You can read more about those two methods [here](https://vitess.io/docs/user-guides/migration/migrate-data/). There is no option to do an application level migration. The biggest challenge with this sort of migration is you must be able to access the source database from the location where you want to put the target database. You will need to ensure this configuration constraint is resolved and set up prior to any sort of migration. ## What is Vstream and how does it work? VStream is a change notification service accessible via VTGate. The purpose of VStream is to provide equivalent information to the MySQL binary logs from the underlying MySQL shards. gRPC clients, including Vitess components like VTTablets, can subscribe to a VStream to receive change events from other shards. The VStream pulls events from one or more VStreamer instances on VTTablet instances, which in turn pulls events from the binary log of the underlying MySQL instance. This allows for efficient execution of functions such as VReplication where a subscriber can indirectly receive events from the binary logs of one or more MySQL instance shards, and then apply it to a target instance. --- title: Overview weight: 1 --- ## How do I migrate my data to Vitess? There are two main parts to migrating your data to Vitess: migrating the actual data and repointing the application. The answer here will focus primarily on the methods that can be used to migrate your data into Vitess. There are three different methods to migrate your data into Vitess. Choosing the appropriate option depends on several factors like: - The nature of the application accessing the MySQL database - The size of the MySQL database to be migrated - The load, especially the write load, on the MySQL database - Your tolerance for downtime during the migration of data - Whether you require the ability to reverse the migration if need be - The network level configuration of your components The three different methods are: - ‘Stop-the-world’ - VReplication from Vitess setup in

hundreds of thousands of queries per second, so keep in mind that any scaling challenges you might face could also be resolved by optimizing your code, queries, schema and/or MySQL configuration. One common challenge faced by users implementing a large-scale microservices architecture, while still keeping a unified database architecture, is that the number of MySQL protocol client connections to the central database can become overwhelming, even with client-side connection pooling. Vitess handles this by effectively introducing additional layers of connection pooling, ensuring that the backend MySQL instances are not overwhelmed. --- title: Topology weight: 4 --- ## What is the topology service? How does it work? The Topology Service is a set of backend processes. This service is exposed to all Vitess components. It delivers a key/value service that is highly available and consistent, while being offset by having higher latency cost and very low throughput. The Topology Service is used for several things by Vitess: * It enables tablets to coordinate among themselves as a cluster. * It enables VTGate to discover tablets, so it knows where to route queries. * It stores Vitess configuration provided by the administrator which is required by the different components in the Vitess cluster and that must persist between server restarts. The main functions the Topology Service provides are: * It is both a repository for topology metadata and a distributed lock manager. * It is used to store configuration data about the Vitess cluster. It stores small data structures (a few hundred bytes) per object. * E.g. information about the Keyspaces, the Shards, the Tablets, the Replication Graph, and the Serving Graph. * It supports a watch interface that signals a client when changes occur on an object. This is used, for instance, by VTGate to know when the VSchema changes. * It supports primary election. * It supports quorum reads and writes. ## What Topology servers can I use with Vitess? Vitess uses a plugin implementation to support multiple backend technologies for the Topology Service. The servers currently supported are as follows: * etcd * ZooKeeper The Topology Service interfaces are defined in our code in go/vt/topo/, specific implementations are in go/vt/topo/<name>, and we also have a set of unit tests for it in go/vt/topo/test. {{< info >}} If starting from scratch, please use the `etcd` implementation. {{< /info >}} ## How do I choose which topology server to use? The first question to consider is: do you use one already or are you required to use a specific one? If the answer to that question is yes, then you should likely implement that rather than adding a new server to run Vitess. However, in large implementations, it makes sense to run a separate topology server dedicated to Vitess. This avoids "noisy neighbor" problems. By default, we recommend that you use etcd if you can, otherwise you may use ZooKeeper. ## How do I implement etcd (etcd2)? If you want to implement etcd we recommend following the steps on Vitess’ documentation
