TEST CASE 1: What are the two main paths (data path and control path) in Vitess that can be secured using TLS?
Expected Chunks: 1
  1. There are two paths a data path and a control path that could be secured. The focus in the guide will be to secure the data path.

TEST CASE 2: Describe the process of setting up gRPC TLS encryption between vtgate and vttablet instances?
Expected Chunks: 1
  1. To secure this data path you need to, at a minimum, configure TLS for gRPC on the server (vttablet) side. Other components, as detailed above, also connect to vttablet via gRPC. After configuring vttablet gRPC for TLS, you will need to configure all these components (vtgate, other vttablets, vtctld) explicitly to connect using TLS to vttablet via gRPC, or you will have a partially or wholly non-functional system.

TEST CASE 3: How can you configure a vttablet to connect to a MySQL instance using TLS, and what flags are required to enforce server certificate validation?
Expected Chunks: 1
  1. Now, configure vttablet to connect to MySQL using the necessary parameters, verifying the CA certificate: ```bash $ cp /home/user/CA/pki/ca.crt ~/config/ ``` Add the vttablet parameters: ``` --db_ssl_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt --db_flags 1073743872 --db_server_name mysql1 ``` Restart the vttablet. Note that the `db_server_name` parameter value will differ depending on your issued certificate common name; and is unnecessary if the certificate common name matches the DNS name vttablet is using to connect to the MySQL server. The `1073743872` is a combination of the MySQL `CLIENT_SSL` (2048) and `CLIENT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` flags (1073741824); which means "encrypt the connection to MySQL *and* verify the SSL cert presented by the server".

TEST CASE 4: What are the differences between TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS) and username/password authentication in Vitess?
Expected Chunks: 1
  1. Client authentication in Vitess can take two forms, depending on the protocol in question: * TLS client certificate authentication (also known as mTLS) * Username/password authentication; this is only an option for the connections involving the MySQL protocol.
