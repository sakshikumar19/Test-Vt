TEST CASE 1: How can I debug elevated query latency on a Vitess primary?
Expected Chunks: 3
  1. Inspect the graphs to see if QPS has gone up. If yes, drill down on the more detailed QPS graphs to see which table, or user caused the increase.
  2. If a table is identified, look at /debug/queryz for queries on that table.
  3. If QPS did not go up, only latency did, inspect the per-table latency graphs.

TEST CASE 2: What should I do if my Vitess primary starts up in read-only mode?
Expected Chunks: 3
  1. To prevent accidentally accepting writes, our default my.cnf settings tell MySQL to always start up read-only.
  2. If VTOrc is running, then it will take care of converting the primary to read-write mode.
  3. To fix manually, you can use the [`SetReadWrite`](../../reference/programs/vtctl/tablets/#setreadwrite) command.

TEST CASE 3: How do I inform Vitess of a new primary tablet after a manual failover?
Expected Chunks: 3
  1. If you do a failover manually (not through Vitess), you'll need to tell Vitess which tablet corresponds to the new primary MySQL.
  2. Use the [`TabletExternallyReparented`](../../reference/programs/vtctl/shards/#tabletexternallyreparented) command to tell Vitess the new primary tablet for a shard.
  3. Older versions of Vitess supported tools like [Orchestrator](https://github.com/github/orchestrator), which can be configured to call this automatically.

TEST CASE 4: Where can I find troubleshooting resources in Vitess?
Expected Chunks: 3
  1. If there is a problem in the system, one or many alerts would typically fire.
  2. When an alert fires, you have the following sources of information to perform your investigation:

* Graphs
* Diagnostic URLs
* Log files
