QUESTION: Can I run a single VTOrc instance for multiple keyspaces in the operator?

ANSWER: ### Running a Single VTOrc Instance for Multiple Keyspaces
According to the provided context, the Vitess operator deploys **one VTOrc instance for each keyspace** that it is configured for. 

There is no information in the context that suggests you can run a single VTOrc instance for multiple keyspaces in the operator. 

To determine if this is possible, you may need to consult the Vitess Operator documentation or the VTOrc reference page for more information on configuring VTOrc instances.

Running with Vitess Operator description: How to configure Vitess Kubernetes Operator to run VTOrc --- ## Get Started The Vitess operator deploys one VTOrc instance for each keyspace that it is configured for. Please look at the [VTOrc reference page](../../programs/vtorc) to know all the flags that VTOrc accepts. ## Configuring VTOrc in Vitess Operator The VTOrc can be configured to run for a given keyspace by specifying the `vitessOrchestrator` specification as part of the `keyspace` spec. Resource limits and requests can be specified as part of the configuration and the default behaviour of VTOrc can be changed by specifying any desired flags in the `extraFlags` field. The VTOrc UI runs on the port `15000` of the container and port-forwarding can be setup to access it. ## Example Configuration An example deployment from the VTOrc [end to end test](https://github.com/planetscale/vitess-operator/tree/main/test/endtoend) on the Vitess Operator looks like: ```yaml keyspaces: - name: commerce durabilityPolicy: semi_sync turndownPolicy: Immediate vitessOrchestrator: resources: limits: memory: 128Mi requests: cpu: 100m memory: 128Mi extraFlags: recovery-period-block-duration: 5s ``` The full configuration file is available [here](https://github.com/planetscale/vitess-operator/blob/main/test/endtoend/operator/101_initial_cluster_vtorc_vtadmin.yaml). --- title: UI, API and Metrics --- # UI In order to use UI, `--port` flag has to be provided. Currently, the `/debug/status` lists the recent recoveries that VTOrc has performed. ![VTOrc-recent-recoveries](../img/VTOrc-Recent-Recoveries.png) # APIs VTOrc supports the following APIs which can be used for monitoring and changing the behaviour of VTOrc. | New API | Additional notes | |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `/api/problems` | This API lists all the instances that have any problems in them. The problems range from replication not running to errant GTIDs. The new API also supports filtering using the keyspace and shard name | | `/api/disable-global-recoveries` | This API disables the global recoveries in VTOrc. This makes it so that VTOrc doesn't repair any failures it detects. | | `/api/enable-global-recoveries` | This API

\ --instance-poll-time "1s" \ --topo-information-refresh-duration "30s" \ --alsologtostderr ``` You can optionally add a `clusters_to_watch` flag that contains a comma separated list of keyspaces or `keyspace/shard` values. If specified, VTOrc will manage only those clusters. ### Durability Policies All the failovers that VTOrc performs will be honoring the [durability policies](../../configuration-basic/durability_policy). Please be careful in setting the desired durability policies for your keyspace because this will affect what situations VTOrc can recover from and what situations will require manual intervention. ### Running VTOrc using the Vitess Operator To find information about deploying VTOrc using Vitess Operator please take a look at this [page](../../../reference/vtorc/running_with_vtop). --- title: VTTablet and MySQL weight: 8 --- Let us assume that we want to bring up a single unsharded keyspace. The first step is to identify the number of replicas (including the primary) we would like to deploy. We should also make a decision about how to distribute them across the cells. Vitess requires you to assign a globally unique id (tablet UID) to every vttablet. This has to be an unsigned 32-bit integer. This is a legacy requirement derived from the fact that the MySQL server id (also an unsigned 32-bit integer) used to be the same as the tablet uid. This is not the case any more. In terms of mapping these components to machines, Vitess allows you to run multiple of these on the same machine. If this is the case, you will need to assign non-conflicting ports for these servers to listen on. VTTablet and MySQL are meant to be brought up as a pair within the same machine. By default, vttablet will connect to its MySQL over a unix socket. Let us look at the steps to bring up the first pair for an unsharded keyspace `commerce` in cell1 and a tablet

- These are then fixed by issuing RPCs to the associated `vttablets` ```mermaid stateDiagram-v2 start: Collect Information topoServer: Topology Server vttablets: Vttablets infoCollected: Information Received problems: Problems Found fixes: Run Fixes start --> topoServer: Every <code>topo-information-refresh-duration</code> start --> vttablets: Every <code>instance-poll-time</code> topoServer --> infoCollected: Keyspace and Vttablet records vttablets --> infoCollected: MySQL information infoCollected --> problems: Analyze collected information problems --> fixes: RPCs to Vttablets ``` # Coordination among VTOrc instances and `vtctld` Users are encouraged to run multiple instances of VTOrc monitoring the same cluster because VTOrc too, like any other service is liable to failure for reasons out of its control. Also, users run `vtctld` instances which can be used to run commands which alter the desired topology ([PlannedReparentShard](../../../user-guides/configuration-advanced/reparenting/#plannedreparentshard-planned-reparenting)) and durability requirements ([SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy](../../programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_setkeyspacedurabilitypolicy/)). The most logical question that arises is how do we ensure coordination between multiple VTOrc instances and `vtctld`. We do so by using the existing central topology-server. Each of these services, acquire a shard lock before it proceeds to run any fixes. This ensures that there is only one actor at any given point of time trying to alter the cluster. Another cause of concern could be recoveries run on stale data collected by VTOrc. Since VTOrc instances use a polling method to load the information they use for fault detection, they can sometimes read outdated information. To prevent VTOrc instances from running incorrect/unnecessary recoveries, all VTOrc instances refresh their local information that they require for the fix after acquiring a shard lock. --- title: Running with Vitess Operator description: How to configure Vitess Kubernetes Operator to run VTOrc --- ## Get Started The Vitess operator deploys one VTOrc instance for each keyspace that it is configured for.
