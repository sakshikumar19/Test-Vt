QUESTION: How can I check the status of VTOrc?

ANSWER: ### Checking VTOrc Status
To check the status of VTOrc, you can use the `--table-refresh-interval` flag to refresh tables in the status page. However, **I don't have enough information to answer this question** as the provided context does not mention a specific command or flag to directly check the status of VTOrc.

You may need to consult the VTOrc reference page or the Vitess documentation for more information on checking the status of VTOrc. Additionally, you might need to look into the `vtctld` commands or the topology server configuration to see if there are any options to check the status of VTOrc instances. 

It is also possible that the status page is accessible through a web interface, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

single vttablet lags beyond this value, vtgate will not send it any queries. However, if too many replicas exceed this threshold, then vtgate will send queries to the ones that have the least lag. A weighted average algorithm is used to exclude the outliers. This value is meant to match vttabletâ€™s `degraded_threshold` value. A vtgate that comes up successfully will show all the vttablets it has discovered in its `/debug/status` page under the `Health Check Cache` section. ![vtgate-healthy-tablets](../img/vtgate-healthy-tablets.png) If vtgates cannot connect to one of the vttablets it discovered from the topo, or if the vttablet is unhealthy, it will be shown in red in the `Health Check Cache`, and a corresponding error message will be displayed next to it: ![vtgate-partially-healthy-tablets](../img/vtgate-partially-healthy-tablets.png) You can verify that the vtgates came up successfully by using the MySQL client: ```text ~/...vitess/examples/local> mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 15306 --user=mysql_user --password=mysql_password [snip] mysql> show databases; +----------+ | Database | +----------+ | commerce | +----------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) ``` The `show databases` command presents the `commerce` keyspace as a database. Under the covers, the MySQL database backing it is actually `vt_commerce`. Congratulations! You have successfully brought up a Vitess cluster. --- title: VTOrc weight: 8 --- VTOrc is the automated fault detection and repair tool of Vitess. It started off as a fork of the [Orchestrator](https://github.com/openark/orchestrator), which was then custom-fitted to the Vitess use-case running as a Vitess component. An overview of the architecture of VTOrc can be found on this [page](../../../reference/vtorc/architecture). Setting up VTOrc lets you avoid performing the `InitShardPrimary` step. It automatically detects that the new shard doesn't have a primary and elects one for you. It detects any configuration problems in the cluster and fixes them.
