test_cases:
  - question: What are the two main paths (data path and control path) in Vitess that can be secured using TLS?
    expected_chunks:
      - "There are two paths a data path and a control path that could be secured. The focus in the guide will be to secure the data path."

  - question: Describe the process of setting up gRPC TLS encryption between vtgate and vttablet instances?
    expected_chunks:
      - "To secure this data path you need to, at a minimum, configure TLS for gRPC on the server (vttablet) side. Other components, as detailed above, also connect to vttablet via gRPC. After configuring vttablet gRPC for TLS, you will need to configure all these components (vtgate, other vttablets, vtctld) explicitly to connect using TLS to vttablet via gRPC, or you will have a partially or wholly non-functional system."

  - question: How can you configure a vttablet to connect to a MySQL instance using TLS, and what flags are required to enforce server certificate validation?
    expected_chunks:
      - 'Now, configure vttablet to connect to MySQL using the necessary parameters, verifying the CA certificate: ```bash $ cp /home/user/CA/pki/ca.crt ~/config/ ``` Add the vttablet parameters: ``` --db_ssl_ca /home/user/config/ca.crt --db_flags 1073743872 --db_server_name mysql1 ``` Restart the vttablet. Note that the `db_server_name` parameter value will differ depending on your issued certificate common name; and is unnecessary if the certificate common name matches the DNS name vttablet is using to connect to the MySQL server. The `1073743872` is a combination of the MySQL `CLIENT_SSL` (2048) and `CLIENT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` flags (1073741824); which means "encrypt the connection to MySQL *and* verify the SSL cert presented by the server".'

  - question: What are the differences between TLS client certificate authentication (mTLS) and username/password authentication in Vitess?
    expected_chunks:
      - "Client authentication in Vitess can take two forms, depending on the protocol in question: * TLS client certificate authentication (also known as mTLS) * Username/password authentication; this is only an option for the connections involving the MySQL protocol."

  - question: How does VTOrc detect and recover from a "DeadPrimary" scenario, and what durability policies must be in place for this recovery to work?
    expected_chunks:
      - "`DeadPrimary` | VTOrc detects when the primary tablet is dead | VTOrc runs EmergencyReparentShard to elect a different primary | | `PrimaryIsReadOnly`, `PrimarySemiSyncMustBeSet`, `PrimarySemiSyncMustNotBeSet` | VTOrc detects when the primary tablet has configuration issues like being read-only, semi-sync being set or not being set | VTOrc fixes the configurations on the primary."
      - "All the failovers that VTOrc performs will be honoring the [durability policies](../../configuration-basic/durability_policy). Please be careful in setting the desired durability policies for your keyspace because this will affect what situations VTOrc can recover from and what situations will require manual intervention."

  - question: What are the key differences between the semi_sync, semi_sync_with_rdonly_ack, and cross_cell durability policies in Vitess?
    expected_chunks:
      - "***semi_sync** - This durability policy sets the number of required semi-sync acknowledgements to 1. It only allows REPLICA type tablets to acknowledge semi sync. It returns NeutralPromoteRule for REPLICA tablet types, MustNotPromoteRule for everything else."
      - "***cross_cell** - This durability policy sets the number of required semi-sync acknowledgements to 1. It only allows REPLICA type tablets from a different cell than the current primary to send semi-sync acknowledgements. It returns NeutralPromoteRule for REPLICA tablet types, MustNotPromoteRule for everything else."
      - "***cross_cell_with_rdonly_ack** - This durability policy sets the number of required semi-sync acknowledgements to 1. It only allows REPLICA and RDONLY type tablets from a different cell than the current primary to send semi-sync acknowledgements. It returns NeutralPromoteRule for REPLICA tablet types, MustNotPromoteRule for everything else."
